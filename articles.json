[I] think that has been very helpful.\"\nEarlier, Phillipson said the law on trans women accessing single-sex spaces on the basis of biological sex \"would apply right across the board\".\nBut she stressed that the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) \"will be setting out additional guidance and a statutory code of practice, because we need to make sure that everyone has the ability to access services that are safe and appropriate, and respect their privacy and dignity\".\nIn particular, there needed to be \"appropriate and available services for all people, including trans people\" when it came to settings such as hospitals and changing rooms.\nPressed on what the ruling meant for trans women looking to use a toilet today, she responded: \"The ruling was clear that provisions and services should be accessed on the basis of biological sex.\n\"But I know that many businesses large and small will ensure that they have appropriate provision in place, for example many businesses have moved towards unisex provision or separate cubicles that can be used by anyone.\"\nThe EHRC has already suggested trans people should use their \"powers\u202fof advocacy\" to campaign for so-called third spaces that are gender neutral to avoid these sorts of dilemmas.\nPhillipson, who is also education secretary, said many places had unisex toilets or individual cubicles.\n\"Go into your local cafe, a local family cafe - [the] chances are that they'll have one cubicle that's self-contained that can be used by anyone,\" she added.\nThe Equality Act 2010 allows for single-sex spaces and services without it being considered discriminatory, such as when a user may reasonably object to another person being of the opposite sex.\nThe Supreme Court found the biological interpretation of sex was required for single-sex spaces\nCampaign group For Women Scotland, which brought the case, warned that interpreting \"sex\" as gender identity under the law would have implications for the running of single-sex spaces and services, such as hospital wards, prisons, refuges and support groups.\nThe decision by the Supreme Court found the biological interpretation of sex was required for single-sex spaces - which can include changing rooms, hostels and medical services - to \"function coherently\".\nHowever, single-sex spaces could exclude people with gender recognition certificates (GRCs) - which give legal status to a transgender person's gender identity - \"if it is proportionate to do so\", the judges ruled.\nTransgender people have said the ruling may erode the protections they have against discrimination in their reassigned gender - protections the judges said they had under other parts of the Equality Act.\nPhillipson, who managed a women's refuge before becoming an MP, said it was important that \"women - especially those who have experienced male violence, sexual violence and trauma - are able to access safe, therapeutic spaces\" while ensuring that \"everyone in our society is treated with dignity and respect\".\nShe said these women-only spaces could now be \"confident as to how they deliver services\" as the Supreme Court had \"set that beyond doubt\".\nAsked whether there was unity among ministers, following reports of division over the issue, Phillipson replied: \"Yes there is, and I speak for the government on this matter.\"\nShe added that she was \"crystal clear\" the government welcomed the ruling.\nSir Keir told ITV West Country on Tuesday that the ruling provided \"real clarity in an area where we did need clarity\" and was a \"welcome step forward\".\nHe added: \"A woman is an adult female, and the court has made that absolutely clear.\"\nMichael Foran, a lecturer in law at the University of Glasgow, said that the discourse surrounding the ruling had been muddied by misinformation and \"attempts to delegitimise\" the Supreme Court.\nHe told the Today programme that some were suggesting the ruling would not affect policies around single-sex spaces, which was \"obviously incorrect\", adding: \"This decision has profound implications for trans inclusion in those spaces.\"\nDr Foran added: \"It's incumbent on the government to communicate clearly what this judgement does and does not say, and to combat that misinformation.\"\nGet in touch\nHow have you been affected by the issues in this story?

        "title": "The Supreme Court ruling gives clarity - but now comes the difficult part",
        "contents": "The Supreme Court ruling gives clarity - but now comes the difficult part\n\"A victory for common sense\" or \"devastating\" \u2013\u202f the contrasting reactions to the statement by five Supreme Court judges that legally the term \"woman\" means a biological woman.\nBehind the different responses lie many of the often bitter and vitriolic arguments that set the country on a long, tricky road towards Wednesday's unambiguous judgement.\nWhen the highest court in the land ruled that sex is binary - meaning legally it should be interpreted as referring to either a biological man or a biological woman - it was providing clarity that had been missing from such conversations for years.\nWords like \"woman\"\u202fand \"sex\"\u202fhad become loaded with different meanings depending on your viewpoint. Language that for centuries had been uncomplicated and accepted, became a battleground.\nThe judgement is intended to draw a line under that.\nIt argues that for the Equality Act to be consistent, the term woman has to mean a biological woman. That does not include biological males, even if they have certificates to say they have changed gender.\nThis means that where there are, for instance, women-only spaces, then a biological man who identifies as a woman cannot use them. That includes changing rooms, toilets, women's refuges, single-sex hospital wards and anywhere designated as for one sex only.\nHow much change that will mean in practice will be set out in detailed guidance. Until then, there remain lots of questions and some confusion - and that is challenging in an area where views are so polarised.\nFrom jubilance to devastation\nIt was Baroness Falkner, the woman who heads the watchdog that regulates equality laws, who described the judgement as a victory for common sense.\nShe added it was only such a victory if you recognised trans people, \"that they exist, they have rights, and their rights must be respected\".\nShe also told the BBC about the abuse she had faced since taking over as chair of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)\u202fin 2020.\nShe had previously told the Times that women had the right to question gender identity, and that had led to some very personal abuse from those who disagreed with her.\n\"I had not realised how difficult the job would be,\" she said. \"It\u202fhas taken a toll, but if you are in public life you have to take that.\"\nThe second response to the judgement was from the trans rights campaign group TransActual, which described the Supreme Court judgement as devastating.\nOne of its activists, Jane Fae, told the BBC the judgement felt like a physical body blow, and that it was as if trans people were being excluded from society.\n\"Today we're feeling very alone\" she said. \"What does this mean - can I use this loo, can I do that, can I do the other?\"\nIn contrast, the women's groups who fought the case feel vindicated and jubilant.\nHelen Joyce, the director of advocacy at the campaign group Sex Matters, says the ruling is \"incredibly\u202fimportant for the half of humanity who need single-sex spaces\".\nWomen's groups argue that the ruling is important for reasons of privacy, safety, dignity and discrimination.\nThe Supreme Court case was brought by a group called For Women Scotland. It wanted to overturn Scottish legislation which said 50% of members on public boards should be women - and trans women were included in their definition.\nDirectors of For Women Scotland speak to the media outside the Supreme Court on April 16, 2025\nThe group lost its case in Scotland's highest court but appealed to the UK Supreme Court. The case was heard towards the end of last year.\n\"What we wanted was clarity in the law - when something is described as a single-sex service, a single-sex space, that this relates to biology,\" Susan Smith from For Women Scotland told the BBC.\nBeginnings of the culture wars\nOver time the arguments over how a woman is defined had become increasingly angry, bitter and divided, because the stakes were high for all involved.\nFor transgender people, who say they often face victimisation and harassment, the battles were rooted in attempts to win better legal protection.\n\"Legal gender recognition is essential for trans people to enjoy the full spectrum of rights each of us is entitled to, including safety, health and family life,\" according to Sacha Deshmukh, the chief executive of Amnesty International UK. \u202fThe charity opposed For Women Scotland's case in the Supreme Court.\nThe question of how to achieve legal recognition rose to prominence in 2002 when two judgements at the European Court of Human Rights found the UK was breaching human rights by failing to legally recognise transgender people in their acquired gender.\nThis eventually led to the 2005 Gender Recognition Act, which allowed a trans person to apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC).\u202fThis recognised their preferred gender rather than their biological sex, allowing official documents like birth certificates to be changed to reflect that.\nBut\u202fit was a long-winded process requiring two doctors to sign it off and for the person to \"live\u202fin their acquired gender\" for at least two years. Only about 8,000 people have applied for a GRC since they came into being, according to government figures.\nCampaigners began calling for the process to be simplified. In a response to a 2020 government consultation on amending the GRA, Stonewall, the LGBTQ+ rights organisation, called for a \"move\u202fto a de-medicalised and straightforward legal gender recognition process\".\nGradually these calls gained momentum.\nIn 2022, the Scottish government introduced a law that would allow people to \"self-identify\"\u202fin their desired gender. This was later blocked by the UK government and eventually dropped as a Scottish policy.\nAs the rights of trans people were being debated, women's groups started pushing back about what that meant for biological women.\nThe meaning of words like \"woman\"\u202fand \"sex\"\u202ftook on new significance, if someone who was biologically male had a certificate that identified them as a woman for legal purposes.\nUnder the 2010 Equality Act, sex was a protected characteristic, and so was gender reassignment. With the very meaning of those categories in dispute, legal experts said it set the protections of one group against the protections of another.\nThe complexities mean courts and tribunals have frequently been called on to arbitrate.\nAnd social media has often provided a starting point for angry disputes, connecting and amplifying voices, and in many cases, leading to more entrenched viewpoints.  It had become a culture war.\nHow the debate began to change\nIn 2019, tax expert Maya Forstater lost her job because she tweeted that she did not believe people could change their sex. She said biological sex was immutable and not the same as gender identity.\nAs a result, her work contract was not renewed. Her employer said it wanted to build an inclusive workplace.\nShe lost her case at an employment tribunal case, but an Appeal Court judge later ruled that gender critical beliefs were protected by the Equalities Act. In 2023, she was awarded \u00a3100,000 compensation for unfair dismissal.\nIt was a high-profile battle through tribunals and courts which put employers' policies on inclusion under the spotlight and raised questions about whether by protecting the rights of one group, another was being discriminated against.\nMaya Forstater was compensated for unfair dismissal\nMs Forstater went on to set up the campaign group Sex Matters, and\u202fwas among those celebrating outside the Supreme Court on Wednesday.\nThere have been other similar cases brought against employers since then. Sex Matters lists 11 settled or ongoing cases on its website.\nBut other high-profile cases have also shaped the broader debate.\nIn March 2020, 23-year-old Keira Bell took legal action against the only children's NHS gender clinic, saying she should have been challenged more by medical staff over her decision to transition to a male whilst a teenager.\nAlthough she eventually lost her case, it started a chain reaction, which led to a shake-up of gender services for children and young people.\nAnd in 2021 the Sussex University professor, Kathleen Stock, quit her job after being accused of having transphobic views. She had published a book that questioned whether gender identity was more significant than biological sex.\nShe denied being transphobic but was subjected to a student campaign to remove her from her post.\u202fThe university was later fined for failing to uphold freedom of speech.\nThese and other cases put an uncomfortable spotlight on a debate that many preferred to ignore or dismiss as mainly happening on social media, because it was too tricky and using the wrong language could lead to abuse.\nYet fundamental questions were being raised about freedom of speech, how we treat each other and how you define a woman. The need for clarity had become overwhelming.\nIn terms of equality law, the Supreme Court ruling provided that.\nFor women's groups there is sheer relief that biological facts will now drive decisions.\nBut for many trans people there is distress. Even though they still have protections under the Equality Act, for many it does not feel like that.  They worry that harassment will increase.\nActivist\u202fCharlie Craggs,\u202fwho is a trans woman,\u202ftold the BBC it was\u202freally sad that this tiny community of less than 1% of the population was being \"thrown under the bus\".\nSupreme Court ruling in practice\nCrucially, the ruling provides a clear framework for what equality laws mean. The EHRC says it is \"working\u202fat pace\" to update its guidance, and expects that to be ready by the summer.\nIt has already made it clear that if a single-sex space, like a toilet or changing room, is women-only, that means biological males who identify as women should not use it.\nIt says instead that trans people should use their \"powers\u202fof advocacy\" to campaign for third spaces, such as unisex toilets.\nAnd it has said it will pursue the NHS if it does not follow the latest ruling.\nHealth service guidance on single-sex wards currently says that \"trans people\u202fshould be accommodated according to their presentation, the way they dress, and the name and pronouns they currently use\".\nCurrently this allows trans women to be offered beds on women-only wards.\nThe NHS says its policy is under review.\nFormer Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption says that while the ruling means organisations can exclude trans women from women only facilities, they are not necessarily obliged to do so.\nHe told Radio 4's PM programme that in sport, for example, it would be down to individual governing bodies to decide who is allowed to compete in women's sport.\n\"They could decide to allow trans women to compete on the same basis as biological women, some sporting authorities do, although I think that in light of the latest judgement, they would be wise to say so expressly in their rules,\" he said.\nBritish Transport Police has been the first body to actually change its policies. It says strip searches of people in custody will be carried out by officers of the same biological sex\nIt means a trans woman would be searched by a male officer, and a police officer who is a trans woman would not be able to search a biological woman.\nThe domestic violence charity Refuge says the ruling will not change the way it operates.\nIts chief executive, Gemma Sherrington, says, \"we remain firmly committed to supporting all survivors of domestic abuse, including trans women\".\nBut for many businesses, sports clubs and other organisations it is too soon to know what this will mean in practice.\nThey will need to see the detailed guidance from the Equality Commission first. Until then it is difficult to know how much change, if any, they will need to make or what new issues might arise.\nSome organisations will also have to decide whether they have the space and money to provide so-called third spaces or unisex facilities\nFor trans people there is also a lot of uncertainty. They will have been used to using spaces which correspond to their gender identity - changing that may be difficult and, for some, frightening.\nThe Equality Commission expects to publish its new statutory code of conduct by the summer. Only then will these questions begin to be answered.\nMore from InDepth\nThe influencers who want the world to have more babies - and say the White House is on their side\nPuberty blockers: Can a drug trial solve one of medicine's most controversial debates?\n'It's unforgivable': The problem at the heart of the NHS's maternity care failures\nTop picture credit: Reuters\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "contents": "The UK Supreme Court has ruled that the legal definition of a woman should be based on biological sex.\nSo as the dust settles on the ruling, what can we take away from it?\nClear ruling\nFirstly, it provides much greater clarity than many expected.\nThe judges ruled that when the term \"woman\" is used in the Equality Act it means a biological woman, and \"sex\" means biological sex.\nIt also makes it clear that if a space or service is designated as women-only, a person who was born male but identifies as a woman does not have a right to use that space or service.\nThe Supreme Court justices argued this was the only consistent, coherent interpretation.\n\nPublic bodies to review evidence\nMany public bodies will now be reviewing their gender policies, but how much day-to-day change we'll see is going to take time to find out.\nThere is already Equality Act guidance which allows for women-only spaces, such as toilets, changing rooms and hospital wards in certain circumstances.\nIt says this could be for \"reasons of privacy, decency, to prevent trauma or to ensure health and safety.\"\nSo, where organisations want and where appropriate, they can already point to this to justify single-sex spaces.\nHowever, cases like that of the nurse, Sandie Peggie, who was suspended after refusing to share a changing room with a transgender doctor, are likely to be reviewed.\nOn Wednesday NHS Fife, the health board involved in the case, told the BBC it noted the clarity provided by the ruling and would \"carefully consider the judgment.\"\nImplications for sports\nIn sports, there have been particularly heated arguments over whether or not trans women should compete in women's categories.\nAnd in recent years, many sports have tightened up rules around transgender athletes at the elite levels. Athletics, cycling and aquatics, for example, have banned transgender women from taking part in women's events.\nOther sports have put in place eligibility criteria. Earlier this month the English Football Association introduced stricter rules, but still allowed transgender women to continue to compete in the women's game as long as their testosterone was kept below a certain level.\nAgain, Wednesday's ruling's straightforward statement that a woman is a biological woman provides a much clearer framework for those debates, and could see rules changed in various sports as a result.\nWhat does the 'definition of a woman' ruling mean for sport?\nGRC certificates\nThe Supreme Court justices emphasised that transgender people already have protections against discrimination and harassment written into the Equality Act.\nThe arguments in court centred on whether trans women with gender recognition certificates (GRC) should be treated as women by the Equality Act.\nThe Scottish government had argued that sex can be legally changed via the gender recognition process, and a transgender person with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) should have the protections of that sex.\nCampaign group, For Women Scotland, argued that these protections should only apply to people that are born female.\nRelatively few trans people have GRCs and the judgment concluded if they were treated differently to those who do not have certificates, it would create an unworkable two-tier system of protections for the group.\nSome people in the transgender community now worry GRCs have lost their legal weight and will only serve a symbolic purpose from now on.\nNext steps\nTrans rights campaigners have said they will be examining the judgment closely to decide on their next steps.\nIt is possible they could attempt to put pressure on the government to change the Equality Act.\nThe Scottish government has also said it will need to work with the UK government to understand the full implications of the ruling.\nSo, while the judgment provides clarity on the law, the jury is still out on its practical impact.\nRelated topics\nMore on this story\nSupreme Court backs 'biological' definition of woman\nWomen's campaigners celebrate court win - but what will it change?\nWestminster's tortuous battle with the gender question",

        "title": "Why Pope's death leaves Argentines 'orphaned' in more ways than one",
        "contents": "Jorge Bergoglio was archbishop of Buenos Aires before he was elected Pope\nWhen the former Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, left Argentina's capital to participate in the Vatican conclave to elect Pope Benedict XVI's successor, he did not know it would be the last time he would see his hometown.\nThe fact that Pope Francis never returned to his country after becoming the pontiff left some Argentines with a heavy heart.\nSpeaking on Monday, Archbishop of Buenos Aires Jorge Ignacio Garc\u00eda Cuerva said his parish were \"orphans of a father who profoundly loved his country and had to learn to become the father of the whole world\".\nHe also added that Francis becoming Pope \"cost us as Argentines a little bit... Bergoglio left us to become Francis\".\n\nLIVE UPDATES: Follow the latest after the Pope's death\nIN PICTURES: Defining images of Pope Francis's life\nPROFILE: Acting head of the Vatican Cardinal Kevin Farrell\nEXPLAINER: How the next pope is chosen\nIt came as a surprise to many \u2013 including Bergoglio himself \u2013 that he was elected to the highest office in the Catholic Church in the first place.\nAt 76 years old at the time - one year older than the typical age of bishops and cardinals when they submit their resignation to the pope - he was not seen as a real candidate to fill the vacancy, according to analysts.\n\"When he left Buenos Aires for the conclave, he seemed somewhat sad; he was getting ready to retire in a room at the Priests' Home in the Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Flores,\" Guillermo Marc\u00f3, a priest from the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires, told Argentine newspaper Clar\u00edn.\nHowever, Bergoglio would soon begin a papacy that lasted 12 years.\nHis death has been particularly keenly felt in his home country, where seven days of national mourning have been declared - as Argentina grieves a man many regarded as simple and humble, despite holding one of the most powerful offices in the world.\nThose qualities were praised by Elenir Ramazol, a nun who spoke to BBC Mundo  during a vigil at the Buenos Aires cathedral on Monday.\nThe fact he did not return to his homeland was \"a sign of the total commitment he made to the whole Church, not just to his people, to his country\", Ms Ramazol said.\nElenir Ramazol said Pope Francis was committed to \"the whole Church\"\nGustavo Vera exchanged hundreds of letters with Francis, having become friends with him when he was still archbishop. He agreed that the pontiff always showed an enduring interest in what was happening in his home country.\n\"Sometimes he commented on soccer, sometimes on tango, sometimes on cultural events,\" Mr Vera, the leader of La Alameda, an Argentine anti-trafficking and slavery organisation, said. Francis followed Argentine news \"in detail\", he added.\nDuring his papacy, Francis visited four of the five countries that border Argentina - but never his home country, despite continuing to take a keen interest in it.\nHe was loved by many there who now mourn him, but others remember him as a controversial figure.\nThe initial pride felt by most Argentines after the announcement that a fellow countryman would be the first Latin American pope gave way to disenchantment among some over the years.\nA Pew Research Center survey suggested that the proportion of people who held a positive view of the pontiff fell from 91% in 2013 to 64% in 2024.\nOf six Latin American countries surveyed, the largest drop in favourable attitudes was recorded in Argentina.\nConservatives in Argentina accused him of undermining historical traditions they held sacred, while reformers hoped for more profound changes.\nCritics felt he failed to do enough to oppose the country's brutal military dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s and to criticise the complicity of some figures in the Church.\nEvery time he was asked about a possible trip, Pope Francis gave vague answers.\n\"I would like to go. It's my people, but it hasn't been planned yet. There are several things to sort out first,\" he said the last time he was publicly asked about the subject, in September 2024.\nSome fellow Argentines found this hesitation difficult to understand.\nPope Francis was revered by many in Argentina, and his image was showcased alongside that of other famous Argentines - Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi - at football matches\nThe pontiff's absence has been felt more acutely in recent years, as Argentina has endured a profound economic crisis, with annual inflation reaching nearly 300% and a sharp increase in poverty.\nMr Vera suggests that Francis was planning to visit, but had not yet done so because he wanted to avoid his presence being used for political purposes.\n\"He always used to say he would go to Argentina when he felt that he was an instrument to bring about national unity, to help overcome the rift, to try to bring Argentines back together,\" Mr Vera said.\nThe \"rift\" refers to the vast, decades-long gulf in Argentine politics and society between supporters and opponents of the populist political movement Peronism, founded by late President Juan Per\u00f3n in the 1940s.\nThere is a widespread belief in the country that Pope Francis was a Peronist - something he denied in a book in 2023, while adding: \"If we had a Peronist conception of politics, what would be wrong with that?\"\nThe comment was seized upon by conservative detractors who accused him of being too closely aligned with social justice causes and left-wing politics.\nBefore taking office, Javier Milei, the current president who has demonised left-wing politics, even called Pope Francis \"the representation of evil on Earth\" - although he softened his tone after coming to power.\nThe two had a cordial meeting in the Vatican and President Milei officially invited the pontiff to Argentina. And following the Pope's death, Milei said he was deeply pained by his loss, and praised the pontiff's benevolence and wisdom.\nSome Argentines accused him of being too close to Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, a divisive left-leaning populist politician, who was president from 2007 to 2015.\nJavier Milei, who had been critical of Pope Francis, nevertheless had a friendly meeting with the pontiff in the Vatican in 2024\nBut according to Mr Vera, the Pope met with people \"from the whole political and social spectrum of Argentina\".\nThe late pontiff's friend also pointed out that, while there was some criticism of Pope Francis in the media and major urban centres, he was loved in other parts of the country.\nAlthough he maintained his connection with Argentina, Mr Vera said, Pope Francis no longer felt he belonged to just one country.\n\"Argentines believe he was Argentinian, but in reality, he was a citizen of the world,\" he added.\nIt is a view shared by Alejandra Castro, a social worker who was among the mourners who gathered on Monday night at Buenos Aires cathedral.\nAlejandra Castro was among those who gathered to mourn Pope Francis\nArgentina was \"always in his prayers\", Ms Castro said. \"In one way or another, he was always present, and I think that shows that in his heart, Argentina was always present.\"\nBut Mr Vera acknowledged that not everyone felt the same way, and suggested it was up to Argentines to look within themselves for answers: \"Rather than blaming Francis, we Argentines should ask ourselves what we were doing that meant we did not deserve the Pope's visit.\"\nRelated topics\nMore on this story\n'God chose this day' - World's Catholics mourn Pope's Easter death\nFinal days of Pope who joined Vatican crowds at Easter despite doctors' advice\nWatch: 'Our father has died' - World mourns for Pope Francis",

        "title": "How a frail Pope defied doctors' advice during hectic Easter weekend",
        "contents": "Pope Francis waves to crowds on Easter Sunday during a public appearance which surprised many\nAt midday on Monday, church bells across Italy began to toll. Pope Francis was dead.\nNot even 24 hours had passed since he had made a surprise appearance on the balcony overlooking St Peter's Square, blessing the 35,000 people gathered to celebrate Easter at the Vatican.\nThe Pope was breathing on his own, without oxygen tubes, despite being told by his doctors to spend two months convalescing after 38 days in hospital with double pneumonia.\nOver the past two weeks Francis had done what he had always done, received visitors and met people from every walk of life.\nWhen he appeared on Easter Sunday, the crowd below erupted in cheers as he appeared; then it fell silent.\n\"Dear brothers and sisters, I wish you a happy Easter,\" he said, his voice heavy with effort.\nThey were to be his final words in public.\nFollow latest updates here\n\"I think people could feel something - as if they could tell it was the last time they'd see him,\" said Mauro, a Rome resident who was in St Peter's Square for Easter Mass and had now returned to pay his respects.\n\"Usually everyone shouts 'Long live the Pope!'\u2026 this time it was much quieter than usual, there was maybe more respect for his suffering.\"\n\"He blessed us but his voice was a husk,\" a man called Alberto told the BBC. \"I think he was giving us his last goodbye.\"\nA steady stream of pilgrims returned to St Peter's\nDoctors who treated Francis at Rome's Gemelli hospital had prescribed a regimen of complete rest \u2013 but it was never likely that a typically active Pope who spent much of his papacy meeting people would keep to that.\nFrancis had already made it clear he wanted to be back in the Vatican in time for Easter, as soon as the specialists treating him explained that his health issues would not be resolved quickly.\nFor Christians, Easter is even more important than Christmas as it symbolises a core tenet of their faith - the resurrection of Christ, three days after his nailing to the cross.\nBefore he was discharged on 23 March, Francis waved to crowds from the hospital too, and then headed back to his quarters in the Casa Santa Marta guest house he had made his home.\nHis medical team said all he needed was oxygen, and convalescing there was better than hospital with all its infections.\nEaster was just three weeks away and, as it approached, the Pope's schedule became increasingly busy.\nHe met King Charles and Queen Camilla at the Casa San Marta and then appeared on the Vatican balcony for Palm Sunday four days later on 13 April, mingling with a crowd of 20,000 people in St Peter's Square, against doctors' advice.\nPope Francis also made an unexpected appearance in St Peter's Square for Palm Sunday\nBut for the Pope, Easter was most important time of all.\nHow the next Pope is chosen\nA vocal critic of the powerful whose influence was felt far beyond faith\nLast Thursday, as he had done many times previously and as he used to do in his native Argentina before becoming Pope, he made a visit to the Regina Coeli jail in Rome where he spent half an hour meeting prisoners and he was greeted by applause from staff and guards as he arrived in a wheelchair.\nIn previous years he had washed inmates' feet, mirroring what Jesus is said to have done with his disciples the night before his death.\n\"This year I'm unable to do that, but I can and want to still be near you,\" he said in a feeble voice to the dozens of prisoners who had come to see him, and who cheered him on as he toured the jail.\n\"We are so lucky. Those on the outside don't get to see him and we do,\" one man told Italian media.\nAs he was leaving the prison, Francis was asked by a journalist how he would experience Easter this year.\n\"Whichever way I can,\" he replied.\nAnd, on Sunday, he kept his promise.\nPrison staff and guards welcomed Pope Francis as he marked Holy Thursday at Regina Coeli jail\nHe held a short meeting with US Vice-President JD Vance before appearing before the crowds in St Peter's Square as the crowd below erupted in cheers.\nHe made his final blessing - the Urbi et Orbi address in Latin, meaning \"to the city and to the world\". Then, Archbishop Diego Ravelli read out a speech written by the Pope as Francis sat silently beside him.\nThen, to everyone's surprise, he descended down to St Peter's Square, where he was driven around in an open-top popemobile \u2013 the distinctive little white Mercedes-Benz used by popes to meet crowds.\nA camera followed him around as he raised his arm to bless the faithful lining the sunny square, and a few babies were brought up closer to him. It was the last time the world saw him alive.\nWatching Francis's blessing on Sunday, Alberto from Rome felt he would not last much longer, although the Pope's death still came as a shock.\n\"I didn't feel happy seeing him, I could tell he was in pain,\" he said. \"But it was an honour to see him one last time.\"\nFrancis died early on Monday in his beloved Casa Santa Marta \u2013 a residenceof 100-odd simple rooms,  run by nuns and open to pilgrims and visitors.\nA little over two hours later, the cardinal chamberlain, or camerlengo, stood in the Casa Santa Marta and made the news public.\nThe Vatican said on Monday evening he had died of a stroke and irreversible heart failure.\nWorshippers paid their respects to Francis during a rosary in St Peter's Square\nThe Pope's rooms were a far cry from the opulence of the Vatican quarters typically destined to pontiffs, which Francis had turned down at the start of his papacy saying he felt the need to \"live among people\".\n\"If I lived by myself, maybe even a bit in isolation, it would be of no use to me,\" he said back then.\nIn the coming days, cardinals from across the world will be staying at Casa Santa Marta as they gather in Rome for the conclave that will choose Francis' successor.\nOutside, in the bright sunshine in St Peter's Square, people mingled with priests and friars under the imposing basilica.\nA group of nuns clad in grey and white glared at a man who, headphones in, was dancing around the square. \"No respect,\" they tutted.\nThe same large screens that broadcast the Pope's blessing for Easter now displayed a photo of Francis smiling and a notice that a special rosary was being held for him 12 hours after his death.\nIt would allow Catholics near and far to pray for their Pope \u2013 and thank him for celebrating one last Easter with them.\nGet in touch\nShare your memories of Pope Francis.

The cardinal will remain in the position during the \"Apostolica Sedes Vacans\", the period between the death or resignation of a pope until the election of the next pontiff.\nHe also will play an important role in the centuries-old ceremonies to mourn Pope Francis.\nThis video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nWatch moments from the Pope's visits to North America\nBorn in 1947 in Dublin, Farrell attended the University of Salamanca in Spain and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, according to the Vatican.\nHe held roles in churches around the world, serving as a chaplain at the University of Monterrey in Mexico as well as at a parish in Bethesda, Maryland.\nAll told, the 77-year-old spent more than 30 years working for churches in the US.\nFarrell was appointed Bishop of Dallas in 2007 until Pope Francis asked him in 2016 to serve as the leader of the Vatican's new department responsible for the pastoral care of families, raising him to the rank of cardinal.\nCardinal Kevin Farrell and other Vatican officials announce the death of Pope Francis in a video statement from the Vatican on 21 April.\nYears after naming him as camerlengo, in 2023, Francis chose Farrell as president of the Supreme Court of Vatican City State. He was also named president of the Commission for Confidential Matters.\nHow the next Pope is chosen\nSend us your questions\nAs camerlengo, Cardinal Farrell will be tasked with making arrangements for the conclave, the process through which the next pontiff is selected.\nTechnically, a camerlengo can become pope, as has happened twice in history: Gioacchino Pecci (Pope Leo XIII) in 1878 and Eugenio Pacelli (Pope Pius XII) in 1939.\nThe cardinal also will preside over the certification of Francis's death, laying his body into the coffin. After that, the cardinal is expected to lead a procession moving the pope's body from the chapel of the Domus Santa Marta to St Peter's Basilica.\nThe ceremony could take place as soon as Wednesday morning, according to the Vatican.\nGet in touch\nWhat are your questions about the next stages for the Catholic Church?\nYou can get in touch by following this link\nRelated topics\nWhat next after the death of Pope Francis?\nFinal days of Pope who joined Vatican crowds at Easter despite doctors' advice\nMore on this story\nVance pays tribute to late Pope, one day after meeting him",

        "title": "Canada's top candidates talk up fossil fuels as climate slips down agenda",
        "contents": "As the threat posed by US President Donald Trump tops Canada's federal election agenda, the issue of the country's contribution to global warming has been largely overshadowed.\nThe two main contenders are pushing plans for new energy infrastructure as the country seeks to pivot away from its reliance on the US.\nMark Carney's Liberals are promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy. The Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax.\nIt's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns.\nLiberal party leader and current prime minister Mark Carney on a recent campaign stop\nIn that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year.\nThat sense of unity is now long gone.\nCarney, who became leader of the Liberals and prime minister in early March, has a long track record as an international champion of climate change.\nAs well as being a governor of the Bank of England, he was a UN Special Envoy on climate action and finance and was co-chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, one of the big outcomes of COP26.\nHowever, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy.\nThe tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products.\nIt was unpopular, and for the Conservatives it became an easy target of blame for the rising cost of living in recent years. Poilievre even sought to paint his rival as \"Carbon Tax Carney\".\n'My home is worth millions - but my own kids are priced out of this city'\nWhat Trump really wants from Canada\nWho's who in Canada's federal election\nA simple guide to Canada's federal election\nSome observers believe that cancelling the tax was a smart political move, others feel it was a mistake.\n\"By making one of your first moves the removal of the carbon price, you're accepting this narrative that climate change policy costs us too much money and isn't good for us, when, in fact, that is not the case,\" said Catherine Abreu, who is director of the International Climate Politics Hub and a member of Canada's Net Zero Advisory Body.\n\"I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.\"\nCarney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into \"a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy\".\nHe is emphasising his pragmatic approach, and his campaign talks about fast-tracking green energy projects and encouraging green transport and buildings, without giving too many details. He has also called for investment in technologies like carbon capture.\nThere are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.\nOpinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore.\nThe war in Ukraine has also put new emphasis on the country's bountiful natural resources in oil, gas and critical minerals.\n\"We have had a parade of geopolitical allies turning up on our doorstep saying, we want your rocks, we want Canada to be the geopolitically secure primary resource commodity provider, in place of Russia,\" said Mark Winfield, a professor in the faculty of environmental and urban change at Toronto's York University.\n\"And that's created another sort of dynamic in all of this, which was not present in previous elections.\"\nEven with the worst wildfire season in Canada's recent history, the Autumn of 2023 saw voters start to lose interest in climate change as an issue\nPierre Poilievre is the man seeking to replace Carney as PM.\nHe is running on cost of living issues, and advocating for tougher policies on law and order and what he considers \"woke\" cultural issues.\nPoilievre, whose party has a strong voter base in energy-rich regions of the country, is pushing for a major expansion of the oil and gas industries and the removal of the carbon tax on industry.\nWhile he has remained tight-lipped on whether he supports Canada's net-zero goals, he has argued that it would be better for the world if India and other Asian countries were to replace \"dirty coal\" with cleaner Canadian oil and gas.\nAccording to Prof Winfield, the Conservative proposals to boost oil and gas is likely to prove attractive to voters, even if the merits of expanding production don't stand up to scrutiny.\nConservative leader Pierre Poilievre wants to expand Canada's oil and gas industry\nHe told the BBC it's more \"at the in-principal level as a response to Trump, as opposed to any real thinking through of what are the implications on climate, and whether this is actually economically viable\".\nRegardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president.\nThat is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.\nCanada is America's largest foreign supplier of oil, with around 90% of crude production heading south of the border, and the impact of energy tariffs could well be disastrous for jobs and the economy.\n\"Our relationship with the US has completely changed,\" Carney said last week in the first of two election debates.\n\"The pipelines are a national security problem for us.\"\nThat concern over US dependence has revived interest in pipelines that would move oil and gas from the western provinces, where they are mainly produced, to the east, where they could be exported to new overseas markets.\nA previous attempt called the Energy East pipeline was shelved in 2017 due to a number of factors, including fierce opposition from some regions of the country and regulatory hurdles.\nIn this campaign, both the Liberals and Conservatives have promised to fast track \"energy corridors\",  though Carney has flip-flopped on his support for pipelines,, external knowing they are deeply unpopular with environmentalists.\nHe is trying to walk a fine line between defending Canada as a nation under threat from Trump, and taking action on a warming climate.\nThe Insurance Bureau of Canada reported that in 2024, there were C$8.5bn ($6.1bn;  \u00a34.6bn) in weather-related insured losses, triple the figure for 2023.\nAnd while the two election frontrunners are advocating a major role for fossil fuels in Canada's economy, this approach will clash head on with the country's climate commitments.\nYves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, a federal party based in Quebec, has accused the pair of being in a \"denial situation about climate change\".\n\"I'm sorry to crash your party guys, but you are telling fairy tales\" about clean oil and gas, he said in last week's debates.\nCanada has promised on the international stage to curb carbon emissions by 40-45% by 2030 based on the levels in 2005.\nAs of 2023, carbon output was only down 8.5%.\nWhoever wins the election will have a real challenge to square that circle.\nCanadians go to the polls on 28 April.\nRelated topics",

        "contents": "Russia's ceasefire in Ukraine lasted only 30 hours, and even then it appears to have been very limited in scope, with accusations of violations on both sides.\nKyiv said there had been no \"air raids alerts\" on Sunday during Vladimir Putin's \"Easter truce\" and President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested this could be the \"easiest\" format to extend for 30 days and possibly more.\nThe US had tried to organise a 30-day ceasefire but that never took hold, and this latest chapter underscores the difficulty in achieving even a brief pause in fighting,\nRussia insisted on a number of conditions, including a halt to Ukraine re-arming and recruiting new fighters as well as \"underlying causes of the conflict\".\nOne major factor hampering the talks' progress is the long history of broken ceasefire deals, resulting in deep mistrust between the two neighbours.\nDuring his tempestuous meeting with Donald Trump in February, Zelensky accused Russia of violating 25 ceasefire agreements since 2014, and argued that no such deal would hold without security guarantees.\nIn turn, Russia accuses the Ukrainian president of being \"incapable\" of implementing any such agreements.\nIndependent experts say Russia bears the brunt of the blame for broken truces, even though Ukraine bears some responsibility, too.\nStatements by current and former Russian officials also indicate that Moscow would be prepared to cease hostilities, only if its original objectives are achieved - namely a demilitarised, neutral and non-nuclear Ukraine.\nMistrust dates back to Russia's 2014 invasion\nBy invading Ukraine in 2014, Russia violated the Agreement on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership between the two countries signed in 1997. Article 2 said the sides \"respect each other's territorial integrity and confirm the inviolability of existing borders between them\".\nThe war has been rife with accusations of treachery from the very beginning.\nGen Viktor Muzhenko, the chief of Ukraine's General Staff at the time, accuses Russia of going back on agreements allowing Ukrainian troops to pull out from the eastern town of Ilovaysk in August 2014.\nAs a result, withdrawing convoys came under fire, and at least 366 Ukrainian fighters were killed.\nWhy did Putin's Russia invade Ukraine?\nMinsk agreements signed and broken\nThe first Minsk deal in 2014 involved Russia and pro-Russian proxy leaders and Ukraine\nThe first major ceasefire agreement, signed on 5 September 2014 in Minsk, was broken within hours of being signed, with Ukrainian sources reporting attacks by Russian proxy forces on Donetsk airport. Attacks on other Ukrainian towns in the region, such as Debaltseve, continued, too.\nThis prompted the second attempted truce, known as Minsk-2, but it was even shorter.\nWithin minutes of it going into effect on 15 February 2015, observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reported mortar and artillery fire in Donetsk. They were deployed to the war zone at Ukraine's request to monitor the security situation including any ceasefire violations, but they did not explicitly say who committed them.\nWhat followed was a string of other failed ceasefire attempts. Again, some were broken within minutes of coming into force.\nThey included Easter truces in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the \"school ceasefires\" of 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 which were meant to allow schoolchildren near the frontline to go back to school in September, Christmas and New Year ceasefires in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and the \"bread ceasefires\" of 2017, 2018 and 2019 to allow the harvesting of grain, and others.\nA \"comprehensive ceasefire\" that went into effect on 27 July 2020 only lasted 20 minutes, according to Kyiv. Still, it had an effect on the fighting, halving the number of fatalities among Ukrainian soldiers in the following year.\nWho is to blame?\nMatthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London, argues that Russia has never entered ceasefire talks in good faith.\n\"Russia has never been sincere about removing or ending the risk of the use of force in seeking its objectives,\" he says.\nBecause of various ceasefire agreements between Ukraine and Russia, \"the level of fighting has ebbed and flowed, and Ukraine bears some responsibility for part of that\", he tells the BBC.\n\"But the underlying challenge has been that there has always been a Russian or Russian-backed military threat, and that informs things.\"\nJohn Herbst, a former US ambassador to Kyiv who now works for the Washington-based think-tank Atlantic Council, argues that Russia, not Ukraine was the \"serial violator\" of the Minsk ceasefire accords, the first and still one of the most comprehensive attempts to broker a truce in Ukraine.\nVerifying claims of ceasefire violations is not easy because almost all independent journalists are banned from Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine.\nBBC journalist Olga Ivshina, who was on the ground in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region reporting about the earlier stages of the war, says there were reports of Ukraine retaking villages in 2016-19, a successful Ukrainian offensive outside Mariupol, and Ukrainian tanks were spotted too close to the frontline, where they should not have been under the ceasefire deals.\n\"All of these were proclaimed as violations by Moscow. But of course they forgot to mention that their capture of Debaltseve in 2015 was the biggest violation of all,\" Ivshina says.\nRussian proxy forces advanced on the town of Debaltseve in 2015 despite the ceasefire\nDespite the Minsk accords, Russian-controlled forces launched an offensive against the town of Debaltseve, claiming that it was not covered by the ceasefire deal.\nZelensky has described the Minsk accords as a \"trap\" for Ukraine which allowed Russia to prepare for the full-scale invasion.\nPutin says neither Ukraine nor its Western backers had intended to implement the Minsk deals. Their fate was sealed when Russia declared the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk \"people's republics\" - separatist entities it had helped to set up - as independent states.\nWhat next?\nPutin's \"Easter truce\" was never more than a lull, but President Trump said \"hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week\".\nSo far there has been no indication that the Kremlin will accept the US call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, agreed to by Ukraine.\nTrump has already warned that if either party makes ceasefire talks difficult, \"we're just gonna take a pass\" and walk away.\nRussia's demand for \"the underlying causes of the conflict\" to be resolved suggest it has not moved from its original objective of undermining Ukraine's sovereignty - through negotiations as well as military means.\nVladislav Surkov, a former close adviser to Vladimir Putin who was known as the \"grey cardinal\" of Russian politics, celebrates the Minsk accords last year as a way of \"legitimising\" Ukraine's initial partition.\nThe very idea of peace, he said, wass \"nothing but a continuation of war by other means\".\nRelated topics",

        "title": "Britain's nursery problem: Parents still face 'childcare deserts'",
        "contents": "Britain's nursery problem: Parents still face 'childcare deserts'\nListen to Vanessa read this article\n\"We have the one of the most expensive systems in the world\u2026 today I want to reform our childcare system\". These words, spoken by the then-chancellor Jeremy Hunt in the 2023 Spring Budget, were a beacon of hope for thousands of parents paying an average of almost \u00a315,000 a year to nurseries and childminders.\nThe promise was to \"transform the lives of thousands of women\" and \"build a childcare system comparable to the best\".\nTwo years on, the rollout of what's commonly known as the \"free hours\" scheme in England is almost complete. From September, eligible working parents will be able to access 30 hours of childcare per week during term-time (for 38 weeks), paid for by the government, for their children from the age of nine months to four.\nOnly it hasn't been the panacea that many had hoped, and there are a number of hurdles still to overcome.\nParents say nursery places are increasingly difficult to find. And experts are concerned that a gap is widening between those who are eligible for the funded hours, and those who are missing out on the childcare revolution. So why has this challenge been too great for successive governments to solve?\nEngland's childcare deserts\nOver the last five years, access to childcare in England has declined. At the same time demand is increasing.\nThe government estimates that by September, an additional 70,000 extra places and 35,000 staff will be needed to cope with the influx of families wanting spaces and more hours.\nA report by the regulator and inspector of early years, Ofsted, external, found that deprived areas that have lower than average incomes are disproportionately affected by persistently low access to childcare.\nDoncaster is a \"childcare desert\", defined as an area where parents have faced low childcare accessibility over time. There are 17 childcare places there for every 100 children.\nFor Jordan Parker from Doncaster, the funded hours have been an \"absolute godsend\". Her two-year-old daughter Riley goes to nursery one day a week. Finding a place however has been increasing tricky.\n\"I have to set off at 5am for work and her Dad steps in for some mornings but he's a farmer so he works long hours, seven days a week, so I don't think we'd manage without family help.\"\nJordan Parker from Doncaster says funded hours are an \"absolute godsend\"\nOlena Mykhaylyk says she put her daughter on the nursery list the moment she found out she was pregnant. \"It's crazy you have to be thinking that far ahead,\" she says.\n\"It's great the government offers these hours but if you can't use them, they become negligible.\"\nChildcare places increased by 44,400 between 2023 and 2024, but from September, many families will look to increase nursery hours as the number they are eligible for doubles.\nEducation Secretary Bridget Phillipson has conceded that parents in some areas may not be able to get their first choice childcare place in September. \"It is no secret that childcare in England has often been expensive and hard to find,\" Phillipson has previously said.\n\"This issue is historic, and in some places it is far worse than in others.\"\nAre school-based nurseries the solution?\nOne of Labour's lead pledges last year was to create 100,000 additional childcare places and more than 3,000 new nurseries in schools.\nAnalysis by think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), says it will increase the share of school-based provision from around 22% to 27% of the market, which is \"not nothing\", says the IFS's associate director Christine Farquharson. But she adds that is \"not going to be transformational\".\nIt will also apply more to older children because it is easier for school-based settings to cater for three-year-olds, she adds.\nThe Department for Education (DfE) said 1,200 schools had approached them about opening one. But that is still short of the number needed.\nEducation Secretary Bridget Phillipson: Labour pledged to create more nurseries in schools\nSome 300 nursery schools were approved for funding in this first round, which the government says will create 6,000 new places in total. Of these, 4,000 will open in September.\nAvnee Morjaria, associate director at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), who worked for the DfE when the expansion programme was being developed, says the school-based nursery programme is a \"glimmer of hope\".\n\"If they are delivered and delivered well, I think that has got a lot of potential. It just makes sense in terms of communities and schools and nurseries being the hub of their communities to have that kind of policy.\"\nBut for now, the system is still heavily reliant on private nurseries.\nPrivate nurseries are facing 'huge increases'\nThere are more than 20,000 private and voluntary nurseries in the UK, which provide most early years places, but many are unhappy with the current situation and some are struggling to make the funded hours scheme work.\nPurnima Tanuku, executive chair of National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA), says most providers are facing \"huge increases\" in their operating costs from April, including statutory wage increases, changes to national insurance contributions and rising utility bills.\nThe government says it is increasing its funding for all pre-school children to reflect the wage increases and is providing an additional \u00a375 million grant for nurseries to expand.\nBut some nurseries say the money they receive for three-and-four-year olds is not enough and they can no longer subsidise it with the money parents pay for younger children - as from September the state will be paying for 80% of childcare in England.\nOlena Mykhaylyk says if people cannot use the government hours \"they become negligible\"\nThe DfE is also clamping down on nurseries charging for extras, such as meals, snacks and nappies. Its updated guidance says that nurseries are entitled to ask parents to pay for such extras - but these charges must be clear and are voluntary.\nThis is causing \"enormous stress,\" claims Ms Tanuku.\n\"We can't give out meals for free\" one nursery owner told me, \"we just don't know how this is going to work\".\nSome nurseries have threatened to pull out of the scheme altogether.\nBut Phillipson says that \"despite the inherited challenges\", they are pressing ahead \"with the investment and leadership needed to support families and make sure that every child, regardless of background, can access the high-quality early education they deserve\".\nIn the meantime, local authority-run nurseries are continuing their long term decline. The BBC has found that 23 council-run nurseries, 16 Sure Start centres and 12 maintained nursery schools, which offer funded hours, are either under review, being privatised or in the process of closing across England.\nStaffing was one of the main reasons given. Finding suitable trained staff remains a real problem for the sector.\nWorking families and eligibility\nThe cost of childcare in the UK remains one of the highest in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, for many parents who cannot access the free hours.\nTo qualify for the new hours, all adults in a household must be working and earn more than \u00a39,518 but less than \u00a3100,000 per year.\nDavid from London was devastated to find out that he and his wife were not eligible for the free hours. His wife is retraining to be an occupational therapist so they aren't classed as a \"working family\". And London and the East of England have the highest childcare costs in England.\n\"We just assumed we were eligible and didn't think for a second we wouldn't be,\" he says. \"It's just the unfairness of it\u2026 it seems to be a huge oversight.\n\"The NHS does offer a bursary but we are having to use our savings and are paying \u00a320,000 a year now on childcare. It's a huge disincentive to retraining and to a lot of people it would be prohibitive.\"\nThe government says there is a range of support for students in further or higher education.\nNurseries are entitled to ask parents to pay for extras , such as snacks and nappies, but charges must be voluntary\nCoram Family and Childcare's annual report, which looks at the cost of childcare, warned that families who aren't eligible, are not in work, or who do not earn enough to be eligible are now paying an average of around \u00a35,000 a year more than families who do have access, for a part-time place for a child under two.\nThis raises questions, according to the report, about whether disadvantaged children have the same opportunities as their more affluent peers.\nResearch by IPPR with Save the Children found that the childcare expansion is at risk of not delivering for those families. Only a third of the poorest families use formal childcare, compared to almost three quarters of the highest earning households.\n\"The government is in a really tough spot,\" says Ms Morjaria. \"They have this kind of legacy policy that the Conservative government have chosen to fund and it clearly leaves out a section of young children and gives access to those with working families.\n\"Is it a gap widening policy? Of course it is, particularly where you think about early childcare as early education, because there is a really substantial proportion of young children not receiving that.\"\nQuestion of child development\nThe government's other ambition is for 75% of children to reach a \"good level of development\" at the end of reception, by 2028. (This includes skills like being able to follow instructions in maths and literacy.)\nThe figure was 67.7% in 2023 to 2024. Phillipson has said \"giving every child the best start in life is my top priority, and integral to our mission to ensure tens of thousands more children are school ready every year\".\nThe poorest children have access to 15 hours a week of free childcare during term-time when they are two, but children of working parents will have access to 30 hours from nine months.\n\"That's quite difficult\", says Ms Farquharson. \"It is that disadvantaged group that's precisely those most vulnerable children [who] you want to target and support.\"\nThe government is doubling the amount it spends on childcare\nIn the Shirecliffe area of Sheffield, Meadows Nursery opened during the pandemic in joint venture with the local school, Sheffield Hallam University and charity, Save the Children.\nThe idea was to help children who were already behind and give parents access to spaces. \"A private nursery would not have opened here in a million years\", claims Claire Carroll, who is head of nurseries at the university.\nMost of the children in the 40-place setting are two and three, and receive 15 hours a week of free childcare. \"We find many of them haven't reached their physical milestones,\" she says.\n\"They might live in a one bedroom flat with six people in it and no balcony, they haven't got a garden to run around in and the local parks are run down and not necessarily safe.\"\nShe believes that it is vital to give this group of children more access to free childcare.\nThe Dfe has announced \"the largest ever uplift to the early years pupil premium, increasing the rate by over 45%\", so the most disadvantaged children are accessing the high-quality early years education they need, a spokesperson said.\nA system under strain\nThe government is doubling the amount it spends on childcare to help parents back into the workplace. By 2026, it will cost around \u00a38bn. But the system is under strain.\nWhat it needs is the right staff and enough places to make it work. Helping children reach a good level of development is also vital, according to many of those experts.\nPhillipson has been clear: \"every child, regardless of background\" should be able to access high-quality early education.\nIt remains to be seen how the system will cope from September.\nHowever Farquharson believes the government's dual aims \u2013 around growth and child development - are trying to solve different problems.\n\"We're doubling the amount that we spend on free childcare in England,\" she warns, \"[and] when you make that kind of a policy commitment, there's always going to be a risk of unintended consequences.\"\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nMore from InDepth\nThe influencers who want the world to have more babies - and say the White House is on their side\nThe English neighbourhood that claims to hold the secret to fixing the NHS\n'The school system is broken': Why more parents are home-educating their children\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "contents": "The finale of Latey: Looking for Love has been viewed more than 620,000 times\nBoy meets girl. Girl falls for boy. Girl fends off love rivals and boy - finally - declares his affection for her.\nIf you are a fan of reality TV dating shows, you will have seen several variations of this plot - it is a well-worn storyline that has played out on the likes of Love Island, Love is Blind and The Bachelor.\nBut in Ethiopia, this romantic scenario has broken convention.\nContent creator Bethel Getahun won over insurance agent Messiah Hailemeskel in Latey: Looking for Love - a reality TV show that ignited debates about dating norms in the conservative East African country.\nLatey's premise mirrored that of the aforementioned hit US show, The Bachelor (in fact, Latey is Amharic for bachelor/bachelorette).\nTen women had to compete for the affection of Mr Messiah, a 38-year-old Ethiopian-American who grew up and lives in Dallas.\nThroughout the series, the women battled it out in boxing matches, basketball contests and even a bizarre task where they had to devise a TV advert for a mattress, \u00e0 la The Apprentice.\nBroadcast on YouTube, Latey is a rare dating programme in a country where courtship is traditionally a private affair.\nWinning such a ground-breaking show felt \"surreal\", 25-year-old Ms Bethel told the BBC's Focus on Africa podcast. Weeks on from the finale, which racked up more than 620,000 views, her victory still \"feels like a badge of honour\".\nOf course, not everyone feels the same way.\n\"The concept of a dating show is entirely [a] Western idea,\" says Ethiopian vlogger Semere Kassaye.\n\"Dating in Ethiopia has always been a private matter, something that is nurtured carefully and only brought to the attention of family or society when it reaches a level of maturity.\"\nLatey's winner, Bethel Getahun, disagrees with critics who say the show devalues women\nMr Semere, 41, also feels that the show devalues women, treating them as objects to be acquired.\nSeveral viewers voiced the same opinion - one commenter on YouTube wrote: \"Ladies, you are not an object that the one with money can easily pick you up.\"\nAnother asked: \"Lots of creativity on the production but if it is against the culture, what is the point?\"\nMs Bethel agrees that the concept of women openly competing for a man clashes with Ethiopian traditions, but insists that the show is more than its central premise.\n\"The whole point of the show is to represent different kinds of women,\" she says.\n\"If you have seen the episodes, you can see every woman in that episode has a lot of different struggles, backgrounds, and all different kinds of stuff that hasn't really been expressed or represented in media in Ethiopia.\"\nArguably, Latey succeeds in this respect. The women - who include hotel managers, flight attendants and accountants - swiftly bond, sharing their personal stories with each other and the viewers.\nIn one of the more heart-breaking scenes, actress Vivian divulges that she fled to Ethiopia from Eritrea, a neighbouring country that enforces indefinite military conscription for all able-bodied citizens. It has also been widely accused of human rights violations.\nVivian travelled alone to Ethiopia and has not seen her mother in five years.\n\"I miss her so much,\" she says tearfully.\nElsewhere, Rahel, a model, explains that she dropped out of school to take on multiple jobs and provide for her siblings, while other women have emotional conversations about grief and their reverence for those who raised them.\nBy baring these women's realities - and their romantic desires - Latey cemented its place as the \"content of its times\", producer Metasebia Yoseph tells the BBC.\nAs part of the contest, the women participated in basketball and boxing\nMs Metasebia, co-founder of D!nkTV, Latey's production company, says the show \"rocked the boat\", but is far from an affront to Ethiopian culture.\n\"Number one - it is not hyper-sexualised,\" she says.\n\"We leave it on the more innocent, get-to-know-you, stages of dating.\"\nShe says the show also asks its viewers to interrogate the concept of culture, \"sparking dialogue about 'What is our culture? Are we a monolith?'\"\nAdapting a universal reality TV formula to Ethiopia has delighted many, with one fan commenting: \"I totally love the risk-taking, considering how reserved we are as a society... I have always wanted to see other shows in Ethiopian version. This is a ground-breaking moment.\"\nA second viewer wrote: \"I never imagined watching The Bachelor in Ethiopia, but you have done an excellent job bringing it to life.\"\nOff the back of this success, D!nk TV is planning a second series.\nThis time, Ms Metasebia says, a single woman could be the one picking her match from 10 male hopefuls.\n\"We're getting a lot of feedback from the audience, people want to see the roles reversed,\" she explains.\nAs for Ms Bethel and Mr Messiah? Sadly, their love story has come to a halt.\n\"It is long distance because he's in America right now with his son. So it's really difficult... I don't know where it's going to go, basically,\" she says.\nBut Ms Bethel is still close to some of her fellow contestants, who she fondly refers to as her \"sorority\".\nShe is proud that Latey showcased \"the romantic side of Ethiopia\" and believes the show will lead to better representations of women in Ethiopian media.\n\"It is a new way of showcasing women and how they express themselves,\" she says.\n\"It is a new way of seeing.\"\nYou may also be interested in:\nNetflix's Young, Famous & African creator on African success\nLove Island: South Africa's reality show is 'too white' - BBC\nReal Housewives of Lagos: Meet the Nigerian stars\nGo to BBCAfrica.com, external for more news from the African continent.\n\nFollow us on Twitter @BBCAfrica, external, on Facebook at BBC Africa, external or on Instagram at bbcafrica, external\nRelated topics\nBBC Africa podcasts\nAfrica Daily\nFocus on Africa",

        "contents": "This week, Race Across the World returns to our screens, with five teams setting off from the Great Wall of China.\nBut that's not all the week has in store.\nSelf Esteem's new album is out, the next series of The Mangione Trial drops on BBC Sounds, and gaming fans have Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to look forward to.\nRead on for what's coming up this week...\nRace Across the World is back\nAnother frenetic Race Across the World starts on Wednesday.\nFor anyone who hasn't seen the Bafta-winning BBC One show, it showcases five duos racing around the globe for a \u00a320,000 prize.\nWithout phones, flights or bank cards, this year's pairs must travel more than 14,000km - starting at the Great Wall of China and finishing at Kanniyakumari, the southernmost tip of India.\nI've had a sneak preview of the new series, and can tell you the scenery is absolutely breathtaking. But language barriers quickly pose a challenge.\nRace Across the World winner on 'authentic travel'\nSo who's competing this year? The teams include sisters Elizabeth and Letitia, former married couple Yin and Gaz, and teenage couple Fin and Sioned.\nCompleting the line up, we have brothers Brian and Melvyn, and mother and son Caroline and Tom.\nRace Across the World is as much about its contestants as the race and travelling. I'm mostly excited for the inevitable moving moments, as we see the teams pushed to their absolute limits.\nSelf Esteem is A Complicated Woman\nBy Mark Savage, music correspondent\n\"This album is going to get terrible reviews,\" Self Esteem predicted when I caught up with her last Christmas.\nWhy? \"Because people hate women doing well,\" she laughed. \"I'm very ready for a male journalist to say it doesn't make sense, because it's a lot.\"\nThat's kind of the point, though. Out on Friday, A Complicated Woman is an attempt to capture womanhood in all its complexities and contradictions \u2013 and that means moving through musical genres, modes and attitudes with almost whiplash-inducing speed.\nBut Self Esteem, aka Rebecca Lucy Taylor, is too clever to mess it up. Her trademark wit and sincerity are firmly in place, as she talks candidly about social anxiety, crises of confidence, infantilised men, her least favourite sexual positions and being beaten down for speaking up.\nHighlights include The Curse, a stadium-sized ballad about using alcohol as an emotional crutch; and closing track The Deep Blue Okay, where she eventually finds a modicum of inner peace. Along the way, there are guest appearances from Nadine Shah, Moonchild Sanelly and even Coronation Street's Julie Hesmondhalgh.\nShe launched the album with a flashy West End residency last week \u2013 where fans were delighted to discover that A Complicated Woman was an uncomplicated delight.\nMore on the Mangione trial\nLuigi Mangione's case went viral after he was charged with killing healthcare chief executive Brian Thompson in New York City in December.\nHe has pleaded not guilty to state charges, and has yet to enter a plea for separate federal charges.\nSome on social media have celebrated the 26-year-old, and shared anger at America's private health insurers.\nSo what are the facts, and what are the conspiracies?\nThe Mangione Trial, on BBC Sounds, aims to unpick this. The latest episode drops on Wednesday, and looks at how the US healthcare system works.\nIt hears from a mother who says she spent $40,000 (\u00a330,000) on her daughter's treatment while also battling for her insurance to cover it.\nFuture episodes will dive into what conspiracy theories are, and why people become so obsessed with them.\nDefying destiny in Clair Obscur and Until Dawn\nBy Tom Richardson, Newsbeat reporter\nDark fantasy Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, out Thursday for PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Game Pass, quite literally caught people's eyes when it was first revealed at last year's Summer Game Fest.\nAs video games go, it's a stunner, with gorgeous art direction heavily inspired by France's 19th century Belle \u00c9poque era.\nPlayers control a crew of characters on a quest to destroy the Paintress \u2013 a being who emerges once a year and scrawls a number onto a monolith. If someone's age matches the digits, they die (hence the 33 in the title).\nSomehow, the 30-person team at French developer Sandfall Interactive has also managed to attract some top-tier acting talent to the role-playing game (RPG) project, including Daredevil's Charlie Cox, Gollum actor Andy Serkis, Final Fantasy XVI's Ben Starr and Baldur's Gate 3's Jennifer English.\nBut the thing that's arguably generated most excitement is the game's focus on old-school turn-based combat. It was a staple of classic 1990s and early 2000s RPG series such as Final Fantasy that's fallen out of fashion in the blockbuster space of late. If the studio sticks the landing with their debut title, expect to hear about Expedition 33 when Game of the Year season rolls around.\nIf that doesn't take your fancy, video game adaptation Until Dawn is out in cinemas on Friday. Passionate fans of the 2015 \"interactive horror movie\" were concerned when the first trailer revealed the film's makers had swapped the game's trademark choose-your-own-adventure device for a Happy Death Day-style time loop.\nBut with Lights Out and Annabelle: Creation director David F Sandberg and prolific horror writer Gary Dauberman on board, and a buzzy cast including Love, Victor star Michael Cimino and up-and-comer Ella Rubin, Until Dawn's fate isn't necessarily sealed yet.\nOther highlights this week\nGood Bad Billionaire is out on BBC Sounds on Monday, telling the story of Selena Gomez\nMatriarch, a memoir by Tina Knowles, is out on Tuesday - I'll have an interview with her out that day too\nAndor, season 2, drops on Disney+ on Tuesday (Wednesday in the UK)\nYou, the fifth season of Netflix's thriller series, is out on Thursday\nMurder on Line One, by Jeremy Vine, is published on Thursday\nFlintoff, a documentary about Freddie Flintoff, is out on Disney+ on Friday\nThe Accountant 2 is released in cinemas on Friday\nJeff Goldblum's new album Still Blooming is out on Friday\nRelated topics",

        "contents": "This video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nGary Lineker says 'it's time' to leave MOTD after more than 25 years presenting\nGary Lineker has said he believes the BBC wanted him to leave Match of the Day as he was negotiating a new contract last year.\nThe presenter and the BBC jointly announced in November that he would be stepping down from the flagship football programme, although he will still host World Cup and FA Cup coverage.\nAsked by the BBC's Amol Rajan why he would choose to leave given his successful tenure, Lineker said: \"Well, perhaps they want me to leave. There was the sense of that.\"\nThe BBC didn't comment on that suggestion, but at the time Lineker's exit was announced, the corporation's director of sport described him as a \"world-class presenter\".\nHowever, the BBC noted in the same statement that Match of the Day \"continually evolves for changing viewing habits\".\nA new trio of presenters - Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan - was announced in January.\nGary Lineker has hosted Match of the Day since 1999 but will soon be stepping down\nReflecting on his departure from Match of the Day, Lineker told Rajan: \"It's time. I've done it for a long time, it's been brilliant.\"\nHowever, asked why he'd want to leave when the ratings were still high and it was a job Lineker still enjoyed, the former footballer said he \"had the sense\" the BBC had wanted him to step down.\n\"I always wanted one more contract, and I was umm-ing and ahh-ing about whether to do three years [more],\" Lineker explained.\nBut, he continued, the matter of how long to sign for was complicated by the cycle of broadcasting rights for matches.\n\"In the end, I think there was a feeling that, because it was a new rights period, it was a chance to change the programme,\" he said.\n\"I think it was their preference that I didn't do Match of the Day for one more year, so they could bring in new people. So it's slightly unusual that I would do the FA Cup and the World Cup, but to be honest, it's a scenario that suits me perfectly.\"\nLineker added that he was pleased his football podcasts had been picked up by BBC Sounds as part of a deal with the corporation.\nThis video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nGary Lineker says no to a politics career when he leaves MOTD\nBBC suspension\nLineker was also asked about comments he posted on social media in March 2023, criticising the then-government's immigration policy.\nThe remarks led to his suspension from the BBC, prompting other sports presenters to down tools in solidarity, something Lineker said he felt \"moved\" by.\nReflecting on his tweets, Lineker said he did not regret taking the position he did, but that he would not do it again because of the \"damage\" it did to the BBC.\n\"I don't regret saying them publicly, because I was right - what I said, it was accurate - so not at all in that sense.\n\"Would I, in hindsight, do it again? No I wouldn't, because of all the nonsense that came with it... It was a ridiculous overreaction that was just a reply to someone that was being very rude. And I wasn't particularly rude back.\"\nHe continued: \"But I wouldn't do it again because of all the kerfuffle that followed, and I love the BBC, and I didn't like the damage that it did to the BBC... But do I regret it and do I think it was the wrong thing to do? No.\"\nThe row erupted when Lineker called a government asylum policy \"immeasurably cruel\", and said a video promoting it used language that was \"not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s\".\nThe home secretary at the time, Suella Braverman, who appeared in the video, called his criticism \"offensive\" and \"lazy\", while Downing Street said it was \"not acceptable\".\nLineker's post reignited the debate about the BBC's impartiality guidance on social media and how it applied to presenters.\nWhile staff working in news and current affairs are expected to remain impartial on social platforms, there had been questions over how much the rules extended to BBC personalities in other areas such as entertainment and sport.\nLineker's tweets reignited the row about how the BBC's impartiality guidance applied to presenters' use of social media\nLineker argued that the previous set of rules \"were for people in news and current affairs\".\n\"They have subsequently changed,\" he acknowledged. \"But that left people like me, who has always given his honest opinions about things, then they suddenly changed them and you have to go, 'Oh, I've got to be impartial now'. It doesn't make any sense.\"\nHe added: \"I've always been strong on humanitarian issues and always will be, and that's me.\"\nLineker said that, following his tweets, \"the goalposts were massively moved because it was never an issue until, suddenly, this point\".\nThe BBC updated its social media guidance in 2023 following a review that was commissioned in the wake of the fallout over Lineker's tweets.\nThe corporation said presenters of flagship programmes, such as Match of the Day, \"carry a particular responsibility to respect the BBC's impartiality, because of their profile on the BBC\".\nAsked if he understood that his comments gave ammunition to the BBC's critics, Lineker said: \"Yes of course, I understand that, but does it make it wrong what I did? I don't think so. Would I do it if I knew what would've happened and transpired? Of course I wouldn't.\"\nGaza doc\nLineker hit the headlines again recently when he, along with 500 other high-profile figures, signed an open later urging the BBC, external to reinstate a documentary about Gaza to iPlayer.\nThe documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, was pulled from the streaming service in February after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.\nLineker told Rajan he would \"100%\" support the documentary being made available again, arguing: \"I think you let people make their own minds up. We're adults. We're allowed to see things like that. It's incredibly moving.\"\nHe added that, although the 13-year-old was narrating the programme, the script had \"not been written by [the child], it's been written by the people who produced the show\".\n\"I think [the BBC] just capitulated to lobbying that they get a lot,\" he said.\nAfter concerns were raised, the BBC took down the programme while it carried out further due diligence. The matter is currently still being investigated by the corporation.\nThe BBC said it had identified serious flaws in the making of the documentary. The BBC board said the mistakes were \"significant and damaging\".\nGambling in sport\nLineker said football should take a closer look at the ethics of gambling adverts and sponsorship\nIn the wide-ranging interview, which will be broadcast on Tuesday, Lineker also discussed his footballing career, his son's leukemia battle as a baby, and his views on gambling sponsorship in sports.\nLineker said the football industry should rethink its responsibility when it comes to taking money from gambling firms.\n\"I know people [for whom] it becomes an addiction, it can completely destroy their lives,\" he said.\n\"There's talk about taking [logos] off the shirts, but you see it on the boards around the ground everywhere.\n\"I think football needs a long, hard look at itself about that, I really do.\"\nOn top of his presenting roles, Lineker is also the co-founder of Goalhanger Podcasts, which make the successful The Rest is History series and its spin-offs about Politics, Football, Entertainment and Money.\nThe 64-year-old indicated to Rajan his next career move \"won't be more telly\", adding: \"I think I'll step back from that now.\n\"I think I'll probably focus more on the podcast world, because it's such a fun business and it's just been so incredible.\"\nAmol Rajan Interviews: Gary Lineker is on BBC iPlayer now and will air on BBC Two at 19:00 BST on Tuesday.\nRelated topics\nMore on this story\nLineker to stop hosting Match of the Day, BBC confirms",

But in March, the family told BBC News that the star died from cardiac arrest caused by the effects of taking ketamine.\nSince making the announcement, they've been working with substance abuse charity Adferiad to raise awareness and tackle stigma around the drug, something Chanel says is an \"important step\" in those facing addiction.\n\"It's hard for me because I think if that stigma wasn't there, would my brother have sought the help he needed?\" she says.\n\"To think that if we'd known, or if he'd have felt able to talk and really reach out for the help that was needed, the outcome could've been different.\n\"That's why we've shared James's story.\"\nChanel and her family are also campaigning for the government to re-classify ketamine from its current status as a Class B drug to Class A, which would put it in the same category as heroin and cocaine.\n\"There's a portion of younger people that maybe look at that classification and think it's less harmful than other drugs,\" she says.\n\"But it's not just about reclassification [\u2026] it needs to include education, police, health, to really raise awareness. We need a strategy around drug usage and drug deaths in the UK.\"\nChanel said their family found it \"extremely difficult\" to talk about James's death but that they hoped \"something positive could come from the complete tragedy\"\nThe UK government is currently seeking experts' advice on the re-classification of ketamine, with Policing Minister Dame Diana Johnson writing to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) expressing concern over the rise in young people taking the drug.\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said: \"Our thoughts are with James's family and friends, and all those affected by this tragic death, which has sadly reinforced once again the serious dangers of taking ketamine.\n\"We will not hesitate to act when the ACMD reports back, and in the meantime, we will continue to work across health, policing and wider public services to drive down drug use and stop those who profit from its supply.\"\nChanel said it had been difficult to share the information about how James had passed away but that the family \"talked about what we can do\".\n\"The Vivienne left a legacy as a trailblazing icon and this, I feel, is James's legacy. To help other people,\" she says.\n\"If I can help one family to not feel what we are feeling, then it's all worth it.\"\nYou can see the full interview with The Vivienne's sister Chanel on BBC Newsnight at 10:30 on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer.\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

        "contents": "Trina Solar is a China-based solar equipment manufacturer with operations across South East Asia\nThe US Commerce Department has announced plans to impose tariffs of up to 3,521% on imports of solar panels from four South East Asian countries.\nIt comes after an investigation that began a year ago when several major solar equipment producers asked the administration of then-President Joe Biden to protect their US operations.\nThe proposed levies - targeting companies in Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam - are in response to allegations of subsidies from China and the dumping of unfairly cheap products in the US market.\nA separate US government agency, the International Trade Commission, is due to reach a final decision on the new tariffs in June.\nThe countervailing and anti-dumping duties, as these tariffs are known, vary between companies and the countries their products are made in.\nSome solar equipment exporters in Cambodia face the highest duties of 3,521% because of what was seen as a lack of cooperation with the Commerce Department investigation.\nProducts made in Malaysia by Chinese manufacturer Jinko Solar faced some of the lowest duties of just over 41%.\nAnother China-based firm, Trina Solar, faces tariffs of 375% for the products it makes in Thailand.\nNeither company immediately responded to requests for comment from BBC News.\nChina warns nations against 'appeasing' US in trade deals\nDesigned in US, made in China: Why Apple is stuck\nIn recent years, many Chinese firms have moved operations to South East Asia in a bid to avoid tariffs imposed since the start of US President Donald Trump's first term.\nThe US Commerce Department's findings were welcomed by the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee - a group of manufacturers that called on the US government to launch the investigation.\n\"This is a decisive victory for American manufacturing and confirms what we've long known: that Chinese-headquartered solar companies have been cheating the system,\" said Tim Brightbill, lead counsel to the Alliance.\nIn 2023, America imported almost $12bn (\u00a38.9bn) in solar equipment from the four countries, according to US Census Bureau figures.\nWhile the planned tariffs are likely to help US solar panel manufacturers, they could also mean extra costs for businesses and consumers who have benefited from the availability of cheaper solar products.\nThe levies would be imposed on top of other tariffs already rolled out by the Trump administration.\nThe planned tariffs were announced just days after Chinese President Xi Jinping completed a tour of Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia.\nThe trip was aimed to boost ties with the region and encourage those nations to resist what he called \"unilateral bullying\" by the US.\nTrump has so far imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are now facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July.\nHis administration said last week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.\nChina has hit back with a 125% tax on products from the US and vowed to \"fight to the end\".\nRelated topics",

        "contents": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has signalled he is open to bilateral talks with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky for the first time since the early stages of the war.\nSpeaking to Russian state TV on Monday, Putin said Russia has \"always looked positively on any peace initiatives. We hope that representatives of the Kyiv regime will feel the same way\".\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Putin's comments indicated a willingness to engage in direct talks with Ukraine about not striking civilian targets.\nZelensky did not respond directly to Putin's comments, but said Ukraine was \"ready for any conversation\" that would ensure the safety of civilians.\nThere have been no direct talks between the two sides since the initial weeks after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nIn comments to the Interfax news agency, Peskov said: \"When the president said that it was possible to discuss the issue of not striking civilian targets, including bilaterally, the president had in mind negotiations and discussions with the Ukrainian side.\"\nIn his nightly video address, Zelensky said Ukraine needed a \"clear answer from Moscow\" on whether it would agree to stop attacks on civilian infrastructure.\nAddressing a short-lived and limited truce declared by Putin over Easter, the Ukrainian leader proposed a follow-up that would \"cease any strikes using long-range drones and missiles on civilian infrastructure for a period of at least 30 days\".\nPutin said the Kremlin would \"analyse\" the idea, telling journalists that \"as for the proposal not to strike at civilian infrastructure facilities... this needs to be sorted out\".\nIn a rare admission, he acknowledged that the military had targeted a civilian building when Russian missiles killed 35 people and wounded more than 100 others in the centre of the north-eastern city of Sumy earlier this month.\n\"Everyone is well aware of the strike by our Armed Forces on a congress centre, I think, in Sumy Region. Is it a civilian facility or not? Civilian. But there was an award ceremony for those who committed crimes in Kursk Region\".\nThe centre of Sumy was busy at the time, with people out on the streets marking Palm Sunday. The region's deputy leader was later fired after reports of the medal ceremony taking place in a local congress hall emerged.\nIn remarks late on Monday Zelensky said: \"Ukraine stands by its offer, at the very least, not to strike civilian infrastructure. And we expect a clear answer from Moscow. We are ready for any conversation on how to ensure this.\n\"There is an obvious, simplest, and most reliable way: stop missile and long-range drone attacks. That alone would automatically ensure the safety of all civilian infrastructure. A ceasefire, real and lasting, must be the first step toward a secure and enduring peace,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, there were reports overnight of Russian drone strikes on the port city of Odessa.\nLocal authorities said three people were injured in the raid, with fires breaking out and damage to residential buildings.\nUkraine is due to participate in talks with US and European countries in London on Wednesday, following a meeting in Paris last week where leaders discussed pathways to end the war.\nZelensky said the \"primary task\" of the talks would be \"to push for an unconditional ceasefire\".\nUS President Donald Trump said earlier this week that he was hopeful Russia and Ukraine would reach a deal this week, after he had threatened to \"take a pass\" on further peace negotiations if no progress is made.\nRelated topics\nMore on this story\nUkraine and Russia report fighting as 'Easter truce' ends\nAttempts to reach ceasefire in Ukraine littered with years of failure",

        "contents": "US stocks and the dollar plunged again as President Donald Trump intensified his attacks on the US central bank boss calling him \"a major loser\" for not lowering interest rates.\nIn a social media post, Trump called on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates \"pre-emptively\" to help boost the economy, saying Powell had been consistently too slow to respond to economic developments.\n\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote.\nTrump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy comes as his own plans for tariffs have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession.\nThe president's intensifying clash with Powell, whom he named to lead the Fed during his first term, has added to the market turmoil.\nLive coverage of this story\nThe S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest US companies, fell roughly 2.4% on Monday. It has lost roughly 12% of its value since the start of the year.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4% and has dropped about 10% so far this year, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.5% and is down roughly 18% since January.\nHowever, on Tuesday, trading on most major stock indexes in the Asia-Pacific region was subdued. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed around 0.1% lower, and the ASX 200 in Sydney closed around 0.3% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed about 0.3% higher.\nIn European early trading, the UK's FTSE 100 stock exchange was marginally lower by about 0.05%, while Germany's Dax was down around 0.5% and France's CAC was down 0.6%.\nThough the US dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence.\nThe dollar index - which measures the strength of the dollar against a set of currencies including the euro - on Monday fell to its lowest level since 2022.\nInterest rates on US government debt also continued to rise on Tuesday, as investors demanded higher returns for holding Treasuries.\nMeanwhile, the price of gold hit a new all-time record high, breaking the $3,500 (\u00a32,613) per ounce mark as investors seek out so-called \"safe haven\" assets.\nThe precious metal is viewed as a safer place to put money during times of economic uncertainty.\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said as well as tariffs, gold's appeal had also increased due there being \"no long-term resolution in sight for conflicts around the world, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza\".\n\"There are also concerns about the risk that geo-political tensions escalate as opportunities in the Arctic are eyed by the US and Russia,\" she added.\n\nChina warns nations against 'appeasing' US in trade deals\nNo global recession despite US tariffs, says IMF\nWhy everyone is suddenly so interested in US bond markets\nTrump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him. Since winning the election, he has urged Powell to lower borrowing costs.\nThe latest criticism follows Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes were likely to drive up prices and slow the economy.\nTrump last week called publicly for Powell to be fired, writing on social media on Thursday: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.\"\nSuch a move would be controversial - and legally questionable - given a tradition of independence at the bank.\nPowell last year told reporters he did not believe the president had the legal authority to remove him.\nBut one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.\n\n'When the US sneezed, the world caught a cold'\nTrump's latest comments come as top economic policymakers are gathering in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.\nChristopher Meissner, a professor of economics at University of California, Davis, and who formerly worked with the IMF, told the BBC's Today programme that before the 1970s there was \"significant\" political pressure on the Federal Reserve from time to time.\n\"However, the past 30 or 40 years what we've learned is that central bank independence is the key to financial stability and low inflation. And I think this is a major reversal and we have to watch out for it,\" he added.\n\"The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,\" added Ms Streeter, of Hargreaves Lansdown.\nThe IMF will publish its latest growth forecasts for individual countries later, and last week it said these projections would include \"notable markdowns\".\nMr Meissner said: \"They used to say 'When the US sneezed, the rest of the world caught a cold'. It'll be really curious to see if that continues.\n\"However, I think people are expecting a pretty significant downturn in the US in the coming months... and that can't be good for the rest of the world.\"\nMs Streeter said that Trump's policies had damaged the reputation of the US, which is \"no longer being seen as a calmer port in a storm\".\n\"Yields on 10\u2013year US Treasuries have held onto their recent rise above 4.4%. It's another sign of unease about the direction of the US economy, amid worries that policies playing out could keep inflation higher and slow growth, and flags the anxiety rattling through the markets right now,\" she added.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

It is a departure, but it is far from a new strategy in TV.\nMatch of the Day has, extraordinarily, had just five main presenters in its history - with Gary Lineker being in the hot seat for the past 26 years.\nHis replacements, who will take over the BBC One football highlights show next season, are all broadcasters rather than sports stars who have taken up broadcasting as a second career.\nLineker and, before him in the 70s and 80s, Jimmy Hill, were examples of former players who were comfortable taking the lead in the studio, but they were more an exception than a rule when it comes to hosting sports programmes.\nNew Match of the Day presenters announced\nThere was speculation that footballer-turned-broadcaster Alex Scott would take over the show - but in the end, the names in the press release are all stalwarts of decades of live broadcasting.\nThe person who might be less familiar to the BBC TV audience is Kelly Cates. But the daughter of Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish has 26 years' experience of live TV and radio on Sky and 5 Live. She knows football and she knows television.\nLikewise, Gabby Logan has been presenting for 30 years. And Mark Chapman has 29 years under his belt and is already the face of Match of the Day 2 on Sundays.\nMark Chapman is already the face of Match of the Day 2, broadcast on Sundays\nBy choosing three new hosts, the BBC is following a pattern in TV where a brand or format becomes less associated with a single name.\nWhen Richard Osman decided to leave Pointless, six people were named as his replacements for the daily show (and another eight for the series after that).\nAngus Deayton's presenting role on Have I Got News For You became an ever-changing roster of weekly visitors to the presenting chair.\nThe One Show may have a core of four main presenters, but the list of people who have over the years done a stint on the green sofa is a long one.\nMatch of the Day has now been handed over to some very safe hands.\nAnd based on their track records, none of them look likely to attract the sorts of headlines that Lineker has had in recent years.\nThere is good reason to be careful. At a time when TV ratings have been falling year after year, Match of the Day has been holding steady.\nChapman, Cates and Gabby Logan (pictured) will rotate in the Match of the Day presenting chair\nIn an era when every Premier League match is televised somewhere and social media is awash with clips of goals as soon as they happen, there was always a question about whether anyone would still want to watch a highlights show.\nHowever, over the past five years, Match of the Day's audience of just under 3.5 million has remained almost unchanged. Over a season, the BBC says 33 million people will tune in at some time to one of the Match of the Day programmes.\nThe resilience of Match of the Day has not gone unnoticed, and with the current rights deal due to continue until the 2028/29 season, this is a brand the BBC hopes to grow.\nThere have been reports that the corporation will use the shake-up as an opportunity to use the MOTD name more widely on its online platforms.\nGiven that the BBC has struggled to compete in an era of rapidly escalating costs for sports rights, it dearly wants to hang on to an audience that may not consume at lot of the rest of the BBC's output.\nThere is also a good reason the Premier League wants the highlights programme to succeed - about half of the league's domestic TV audience see their football only on the BBC.\nIt is a shop window that helps keep top flight football central to the national conversation.\nRelated topics\nMore on this story\nNew Match of the Day presenters announced\nLineker: It is 'right time' to leave Match of the Day\nLineker to stop hosting Match of the Day, BBC confirms",

        "contents": "The documentary centred on the son of Hamas's deputy minister of agriculture\nThe BBC has apologised and admitted \"serious flaws\" in the making of a documentary about children's lives in Gaza.\nThe documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, was pulled from iPlayer last week after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.\nIt said it has \"no plans to broadcast the programme again in its current form or return it to iPlayer\".\nHoyo Films, the production company that made the documentary for the BBC, said it felt it was \"important to hear from voices that haven't been represented onscreen throughout the war with dignity and respect\".\nThe company added it was \"cooperating fully\" with the BBC to \"help understand where mistakes have been made\".\nThe BBC removed the documentary after concerns were raised that it centred on a boy called Abdullah who is the son of Hamas's deputy minister of agriculture. Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and others.\nIt also launched a review into the film, and the BBC's Board met earlier on Thursday to discuss it.\nIn the statement, a BBC spokesperson said both the production company and the BBC had made \"unacceptable\" flaws and that it \"takes full responsibility for these and the impact that these have had on the corporation's reputation\".\nIt added the BBC had not been informed of the teenager's family connection in advance by the film's production company.\nThe spokesperson says: \"During the production process, the independent production company was asked in writing a number of times by the BBC about any potential connections he and his family might have with Hamas.\n\"Since transmission, they have acknowledged that they knew that the boy's father was a deputy agriculture minister in the Hamas government; they have also acknowledged that they never told the BBC this fact.\n\"It was then the BBC's own failing that we did not uncover that fact and the documentary was aired.\"\nHoyo Films have told the corporation that they paid the young boy's mother \"a limited sum of money\" for narrating the film via his sister's bank account, the BBC statement added.\nIt said Hoyo assured the BBC that no payments were made to any members of Hamas or its affiliates \"either directly, in kind or as a gift\", and that it is seeking \"additional assurance\" around the programme's budget.\nIn its statement, Hoyo added: \"We feel this remains an important story to tell, and that our contributors \u2013 who have no say in the war \u2013 should have their voices heard\".\n\n'No stone unturned'\nA full audit of the expenditure on the film will be undertaken by the BBC, and it will be asking for the relevant financial accounts of Hoyo Films so this can be carried out.\nThe BBC spokesperson said the incident had \"damaged\" the trust in the Corporation's journalism - and \"the processes and execution of this programme fell short of our expectations\".\nThey added the director-general of the BBC had asked for complaints to be expedited to the Executive Complaints Unit, \"which is separate from BBC News\".\nA separate statement from the BBC Board added: \"The subject matter of the documentary was clearly a legitimate area to explore, but nothing is more important than trust and transparency in our journalism. While the board appreciates that mistakes can be made, the mistakes here are significant and damaging to the BBC.\"\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer was asked about the film during a press conference with US President Donald Trump on Thursday, saying he had been \"concerned\" about it, adding that \"the secretary of state has had a meeting with the BBC\".\nOn Friday, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said she was going to have an \"urgent meeting\" with the BBC chair Samir Shah later that day.\nShe said the BBC had \"acknowledged serious failings\" by them and the production company Hoyo Films.\n\"I want assurances that no stone will be left unturned by the fact-finding review now commissioned by the BBC's director general,\" she said.\n\"This review must be comprehensive, rigorous and get to the bottom of exactly what has happened in this case. It is critical for trust in the BBC that this review happens quickly, and that appropriate action is taken on its findings.\"\nEarlier this week, the BBC was criticised for pulling the programme by more than 500 media figures, including Gary Lineker, Anita Rani and Riz Ahmed.\nRelated topics\nMore on this story\nBBC pulls Gaza film as it carries out checks over Hamas links\nBBC criticised by 500 media figures for pulling Gaza documentary",

Future plans for Match of the Day will be announced in due course.\"\nAlex Kay-Jelski, director of BBC Sport described Lineker as a world-class presenter.\n\"We\u2019re delighted that he\u2019ll lead our coverage of the next World Cup and continue to lead our live coverage of the FA Cup,\" he said.\n\u201cAfter 25 seasons Gary is stepping down from MOTD. We want to thank him for everything he has done for the show, which continues to attract millions of viewers each week.\n\"He\u2019ll be hugely missed on the show but we\u2019re so happy he is staying with the BBC to present live football.\u201d\nFormer BBC director general Greg Dyke told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Lineker was \"the outstanding sports presenter of his time\", but added: \"Life moves on, presenters don't stay forever.\"\nThe 63-year-old has hosted Match of the Day since 1999. He will have held the post for 26 years when he leaves at the end of the Premier League season in May 2025.\nDyke, who was director general when Lineker first began hosting the football show in 1999, did not speculate on whether Lineker had been \"offered a new contract or not\".\nHe also said he did not know whether the recent controversy over the presenter's social media use was connected with his departure.\n\"Whether this is anything to do with that I don't know. It's one of the few times I've disagreed with the BBC since I left,\" he said.\n\"I thought that he was a sports presenter, and therefore what he was saying about politics was irrelevant to his performance as as a presenter.\n\"But it's there in the background. So it must have been a thought in the mind of of whoever took the decision.\"\nDyke said losing the presenter was \"a big loss\", but \"in the end people watch Match of the Day for the football\".\n'Very hard act to follow'\nLineker told Esquire magazine in an interview published earlier this month that he accepted he will \"have to slow down at some point\".\nDyke also said the BBC is \"in difficulties financially\", referring to recent job cuts being made as part of wider BBC efforts to save \u00a3700m a year, adding that losing Lineker \"would be a saving on a sports budget, which you could use elsewhere\".\nLineker is one of the corporation's best-known presenters and its highest-paid star, of those whose salaries are declared, earning more than \u00a31.3m a year.\nHe has also presented coverage of major tournaments like World Cups and European Championships for the BBC, as well as BBC Sports Personality of the Year ceremonies.\nLineker has worked for other sports networks during his time at the BBC, including US network NBC and BT Sport (now TNT Sport).\nAlastair Campbell, who co-presents The Rest Is Politics podcast, said Lineker would be \"a very hard act to follow\", Sky News reported.\n\"He is an excellent broadcaster and a very good guy,\" Campbell said.\nLineker's new contract has now been agreed and he will leave on a high at the biggest tournament in world football. But replacing a star presenter on a high profile show is always a risk.\nLineker was briefly suspended by bosses last year after an outcry over his social media post about the UK's asylum policy.\nThe incident led to a review of BBC social media guidelines, which concluded that high-profile presenters should be allowed to express views on issues and policies but stop short of political campaigning.\nLineker described the new rules at the time as \"all very sensible\".\nBefore becoming a TV presenter, Lineker had a hugely successful career as a striker for England as well as Leicester, Everton, Tottenham Hotspur and Barcelona.\nAdditional reporting by Mallory Moench, Katie Razzall and Steven McIntosh.\n\nRelated topics",

They had all breached restraining orders, which should have disqualified them.\nHow many prisoners and prisons are there in the UK?\nOn 21 October, the prison population in England and Wales was 87,465, with 1,671 spare places, external.\nBefore the early release scheme began, Ministry of Justice data, external from 6 September showed the prison population was at a record high of 88,521.\nThe \"usable operational capacity\" - the total number of people a prison can hold while taking into account issues such as control and security - was 89,619, leaving spare capacity of just 1,098 places.\nPrison population figures are published weekly and the latest release shows a population of 86,089 as of 9 December.\nThere are 122 men\u2019s prisons, women\u2019s prisons and Young Offender Institutions (YOIs) in England and Wales. HM Prison Service runs 105, external and the others are managed by private companies.\nIn 2018 - the latest year for which comparable data is available, external - England and Wales had 150 prisoners per 100,000 people, the highest proportion in Western Europe.\nPrisons in Scotland have also had to release people early to ease overcrowding. They held 8,260 people on 6 December., external.\nIt has emerged that more than one in 10 of the prisoners let out of Scottish prisons early were back in prison before their original release date.\nIn Scotland, there are 17 prisons, 16 operated by the Scottish Prison Service, external, and one by a private company.\nThe Northern Ireland Prison Service, external runs three prisons, which held just over 1,900 offenders, external on 6 December.\nWhy are prisons so full?\nThe prison population in England and Wales has been growing by around 4,500 a year - faster than new cells have been built.\nThe Institute for Government think tank says this is partly the result of longer sentences., external\nIn 2023, the average prison sentence at Crown Courts in England and Wales - which deal with more serious offences - was more than 25% longer than in 2012.\nFor some crimes, the increase was greater. Sentences for robbery were 13 months longer on average in 2023 than in 2012, a rise of 36%.\nLonger sentences mean more people in prison.\nThere has also been an increase in the number of prisoners on remand, who are waiting for their trial to start, or to be sentenced.\nIn September 2024, the remand prison population stood at 17,662, a record high., external In 2016, it was about 10,000.\nSome of this increase has been driven by a record number of Crown Court cases waiting to be heard.\nMore people than before are also being returned to prison for breaching their release conditions.\nIn September 2024, the number was around 12,500 - another record high - and roughly double the number in 2016.\nMinister warns prison space may run out despite expansion plans\nViolence, overcrowding, self-harm: BBC goes inside one of Britain\u2019s most dangerous prisons\nPrisons plan will fall short by 2027, watchdog warns\nWill the government build more prisons?\nIn 2021, the then Conservative government said it would build an extra 20,000 prison places, external in England and Wales \"by the mid-2020s\".

        "contents": "Kemi Badenoch\nThe Conservatives have said the Human Rights Act should no longer apply to immigration decisions.\nThey are calling for a change in the law that would stop people challenging their deportation on human rights grounds in the UK courts.\nLeader Kemi Badenoch has previously criticised how some foreign criminals and illegal migrants were using the act to avoid deportation.\nA Home Office source told the BBC the Conservatives had left the asylum system in chaos and their suggestion would be totally unworkable.\nThe Human Rights Act was passed by a previous Labour government, and incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) into British law.\nThe ECHR has been a hotly debated topic within the Conservative Party - with some on the right wanting the UK to pull out of the treaty completely.\nThe act has been used to halt attempts to deport migrants deemed to be in the UK illegally, and it stopped flights carrying asylum seekers taking off for Rwanda.\nBadenoch has not proposed leaving the ECHR, but has argued some foreign criminals and migrants in the UK illegally have successfully used the act to avoid deportation - saying, for example, this would undermine their right to family life.\nShe also believes some judges generously interpret the provisions of the act when rejecting deportation.\nThe Conservatives are suggesting an amendment to the government's Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill - which is currently at the committee stage - that would disapply the act in immigration cases.\nThe policy would give her a clear political dividing line with Labour.\nUnder the ECHR, migrants could still appeal against deportation to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.\nCabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that the Conservatives' proposal \"looks like an outsourcing\" of immigration decisions to the Strasbourg court.\n\"I don't think that really deals with the issue and I'm afraid it's symptomatic of the kind of gimmicks without action that we saw for a long, long period of time,\" he said.\nLater in the programme, Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp defended the proposal, saying it would make a \"very big difference\". He said judges have expanded definitions under the EHCR \"in ways that defy common sense\".\n\"Of course we believe in rights, but where you have courts just constantly expanding the definition in a way that was never contemplated at the beginning...it gets out of hand,\" he said.\nPhilp said membership in the ECHR requires \"proper consideration\", which the Conservatives will be thinking about \"in a very carefully considered manner in the coming months\".\nUK may have to leave human rights treaty, says Badenoch\nStop the Boats slogan was too stark, Rishi Sunak tells BBC\nBadenoch said the amendment she is suggesting would be \"critical to shift immigration powers from the courts to Parliament and elected ministers, enabling more effective control over our borders\".\n\"Operating in Britain's national interest means recognising the government's primary purpose: defending our borders, values, and people. Our amendment aims to restore control and prioritise national security,\" she said.\nThe Home Office source said: \"The Tories left the asylum system in utter chaos.\n\"They had 14 years to make changes and instead spent hundreds of millions of pounds on the failed Rwanda scheme, as small boat crossings hit a record high.\n\"This amendment is totally unworkable.\n\"Instead of dealing with mad proposals that will never work, the Labour government is getting a grip of the asylum system, increasing removals of those with no right to be here, saving millions on asylum hotels and looking at ways of tightening the application of Article 8 to ensure the system works more effectively.\"\nThe ECHR was established in 1950 by a number of countries including the UK.\nThe treaty, which sets out the rights and freedoms people are entitled to in the 46 signatory countries, is overseen by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.\nIt is separate to the European Union - so the UK remained part of both after Brexit.\nRelated topics",

We're going to get it stopped, ideally.\n\"Now if, for some reason, one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we're just going to say, 'you're fools, you're horrible people,' and we're going to just take a pass.\"\nDespite the Trump administration's initial confidence that it could secure a deal quickly, attempts to reach a full ceasefire have yet to materialise, with Washington blaming both sides.\nFollowing a meeting with European leaders in Paris about a potential ceasefire on Thursday, Rubio told reporters on Friday: \"We need to determine very quickly now - and I'm talking about a matter of days - whether or not this is doable.\"\n\"If it's not going to happen, then we're just going to move on,\" he said about truce talks.\nHe admitted that a peace deal would be difficult to strike.\nTrump had said before he re-entered office that he would stop the fighting in the first 24 hours of his presidency.\nThis video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\"It's not our war\": US Secretary of State Marco Rubio threatens to move on from Ukraine peace talks\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, when asked to respond to Trump saying he expected an answer from Russia on a ceasefire, said \"the negotiations taking place are quite difficult\".\n\"The Russian side is striving to reach a peace settlement in this conflict, to ensure its own interests, and is open to dialogue,\" he said.\nDuring a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome on Friday, US Vice-President JD Vance said he was still \"optimistic\" about ending the Ukraine war.\n\"I want to update the prime minister on some of the negotiations between Russia, Ukraine, and also some of the things that have happened even in the past 24 hours,\" he said.\n\"I won't prejudge them, but we do feel optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war - this very brutal war - to a close.\"\nVance's comments followed separate news that Ukraine and the US took the first step towards striking a minerals deal, after an initial agreement was derailed when a February meeting between Trump and President Zelensky erupted into a public shouting match.\nOn Thursday, the two countries signed a memorandum of intent on setting up an investment fund for Ukraine's reconstruction as part of an economic partnership agreement.\nThe aim is to finalise the deal by 26 April, the memo published by the Ukrainian government says.\nThe details of any deal remain unclear. Previous leaks have suggested the agreement has been extended beyond minerals to control of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, as well as its oil and gas.\nUkrainian negotiators have tried to resist Trump's demands that a joint investment fund would pay back the US for previous military aid, but have seemingly accepted his claim that it would help the country recover after the war ends.\nThe memo said the \"American people desire to invest alongside the Ukrainian people in a free, sovereign and secure Ukraine\".\nZelensky had been hoping to use the deal to secure a US security guarantee in the event of a ceasefire deal, telling European leaders last month that \"a ceasefire without security guarantees is dangerous for Ukraine\".\nThe US has so far resisted providing Kyiv with security guarantees.\nThe White House argues the mere presence of US businesses would put off Russia from further aggression, but that did not exactly work when they invaded in 2022.\nA bakery was hit during a recent Russian strike on Sumy\nEconomy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko announced the signing of the memorandum on X, external, with pictures of Svyrydenko and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent separately signing the document over an online call.\n\"There is a lot to do, but the current pace and significant progress give reason to expect that the document will be very beneficial for both countries,\" Svyrydenko wrote.\nBessent said the details were still being worked out but the deal is \"substantially what we'd agreed on previously.\"\nTrump hinted at the deal during a press conference with Meloni, saying \"we have a minerals deal which I guess is going to be signed on (next) Thursday... and I assume they're going to live up to the deal. So we'll see. But we have a deal on that\".\nIvanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, an MP and the chair of Ukraine's parliamentary committee on EU Integration, told the BBC the Ukrainian parliament would have \"the last word\" in the deal.\nShe added: \"I hope that there will be enough reasoning to ensure that whatever is signed, and if it is going to be ratified that it is in the interest of our country and our people\".\nOn Thursday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha met Rubio and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff in Paris to discuss how to end the war.\nSybiha said they had \"discussed the paths to a fair and lasting peace, including full ceasefire, multinational contingent, and security guarantees for Ukraine\".\nRelated topics\nMore on this story\nWhat minerals does Ukraine have and what are they used for?\nWhat we know about US-Ukraine minerals deal\nWhy Trump is struggling to secure fast ceasefire in Ukraine",

        "contents": "Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of breaching a 30-hour \"Easter truce\" announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, which has now expired.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russian troops had violated the ceasefire nearly 3,000 times since the start of Sunday.\nRussia's defence ministry said it had \"repelled\" assaults by Ukraine and accused Kyiv of launching hundreds of drones and shells. The BBC has not independently verified claims by the warring sides.\nMeanwhile, US President Donald Trump - who has been pushing for an end to the war - said that \"hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week\", without giving further details.\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and currently controls about 20% Ukraine's territory, including the southern Crimea peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014.\nIt is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people - the vast majority of them soldiers - have been killed or injured on all sides since 2022.\nLast month, Moscow came up with a long list of conditions in response to a full and unconditional ceasefire that had been agreed by the US and Ukraine.\nOn Saturday, Putin said there would be an end to all hostilities from 18:00 Moscow time (16:00 BST) on Saturday until midnight on Sunday (22:00 BST). Kyiv said it would also adhere.\n\"For this period, I order all military actions to cease,\" Putin said in his announcement.\n\"We assume that the Ukrainian side will follow our example. At the same time, our troops must be ready to repel possible violations of the truce and provocations from the enemy, any of its aggressive actions.\"\nHowever, Zelensky said late on Sunday that there was a total of 1,882 cases of Russian shelling, 812 of which involved heavy weaponry according to a report from Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleksandr Syrskyi.\nThe president said the heaviest shelling and assaults were in eastern Ukraine near the besieged city of Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub in the Donetsk region.\n\"The nature of Ukrainian actions will continue to be mirrored: we will respond to silence with silence, our strikes will be to protect against Russian strikes,\" Zelensky said.\nEarlier in the day, he said that \"there were no air raid alerts today\", referring to Russia's daily drone and missile strikes against Ukraine.\nHe proposed \"to cease any strikes using long-range drones and missiles on civilian infrastructure for a period of at least 30 days, with the possibility of extension\".\nZelensky also said Putin's declaration of a truce amounted to a \"PR\" exercise and his words were \"empty\". He also accused the Kremlin of trying to create \"a general impression of a ceasefire\".\n\"This Easter has clearly demonstrated that the only source of this war, and the reason it drags on, is Russia,\" the president said.\nThe Russian defence ministry insisted its troops had \"strictly observed the ceasefire\".\nMeanwhile, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Ukraine of using US-supplied Himars missiles during the ceasefire.\nSeveral hours before the truce expired, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin had not given an order to extend it, Russia's state-run news agency Tass reported.\nThe surprise ceasefire announcement came shortly after Trump threatened to \"take a pass\" on brokering further Russia-Ukraine peace talks.\nHowever, a state department spokesperson said on Sunday that Washington remained \"committed to achieving a full and comprehensive ceasefire\".\n\"It is long past time to stop the death and destruction and end this war,\" the spokesperson added.\nThis video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nBBC Ukraine correspondent reports from Kherson during Easter truce\nThere were mixed reactions about the 30-hour truce from Ukrainians attending Easter morning services in Kyiv and the Russian-occupied city of Donetsk on Sunday.\n\"I do not think this man [Putin] has anything to do with humanity,\" 45-year-old lawyer Olena Poprych told Reuters news agency.\nMeanwhile in Donetsk, which has been under Russian control since 2014, residents expressed similar distrust that Zelensky will stick to the terms of the ceasefire.\n\"I watched very closely his [Zelensky's] reactions,\" said Vladimir, who attended an Easter morning service in the city.\n\"There was nothing about the ceasefire... just some vague statements, not giving any confidence that we will not be shelled.\"\nOn Sunday, the British government described the proposed ceasefire as a \"one day stunt\", saying that the claimed truce involved \"violations, including the killing and wounding of more innocent Ukrainians\".\nThe statement from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said that the truce fitted the \"pattern of previous fake ceasefires\" and instead called for a longer 30 day pause in the fighting, as proposed by Ukraine.\n\"As ever, we see no evidence that President Putin is seriously preparing for peace,\" the FCDO statement said.\nThe US has been directly talking to Russia as part of its efforts to end the war, but has struggled to make major progress.\nOn Friday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US was not \"going to continue with this endeavour for weeks and months on end\", as it had \"other priorities to focus on\".\n\"We need to determine very quickly now - and I'm talking about a matter of days - whether or not this is doable,\" he added.\n\"If it's not going to happen, then we're just going to move on.\"\nRelated topics\nMore on this story\nRosenberg: Is Putin's 'Easter truce' cause for scepticism or chance for peace?\nTrump says US will 'pass' on Ukraine peace talks if no progress soon\nZelensky accuses Trump's envoy of spreading 'Russian narratives'",

        "title": "Generation K: The disturbing rise of ketamine abuse among young people",
        "contents": "Generation K: The disturbing rise of ketamine abuse among young people\nListen to Jane read this article\nAt the urology department of Burnley General Hospital, 26-year-old Ryan (not his real name) is having a drug solution inserted through a catheter - part of his treatment for a condition known as ketamine bladder. This procedure will not completely reverse the damage inflicted by Ryan's previous addiction to the Class B drug, but it will help him manage the symptoms.\nKetamine, a powerful horse tranquiliser and anaesthetic, is a licensed drug and can be prescribed medically. However, when misused, it can cause serious and sometimes permanent damage to the bladder. The hospital is watching Ryan for signs of kidney failure, too. He worries about finding a girlfriend and having children. But he is stoical when he talks about passing blood and having to urinate numerous times a day.\n\"You could not be a ketamine addict for 30 years, 20 years,\" he says. \"You'd die.\"\nHe is under the care of consultant urologist Haytham Elsakka, who says he has witnessed a rise in young patients whose bladders have been damaged by ketamine use. \"Some of them are in their 30s, but most of them are 16 to 24,\" says Dr Elsakka. Around half of young patients end up needing surgery, he adds. Other risks from recreational use include liver failure, damage to the urethra, incontinence and impotence.\n\"We have seen young people under the age of 25 who've completely lost control of their bladders, who have had to have surgery, including bladder removal,\" says Abigail Wilson, lead clinical pharmacist for national drug and alcohol charity WithYou.\nLancashire County Council says it is supporting a growing number of families affected by ketamine addiction in the Burnley area\nIn and around the town of Burnley, Ryan is far from alone. Lancashire County Council says it is helping a growing number of families affected by ketamine addiction in the Burnley area. According to WithYou, which runs a ketamine support service for young people aged 11 to 24, the number seeking help across Lancashire increased from 32 in 2018-19 to 123 by the end of 2024.\nAnd the area is not unusual. In England, the number of under-18s entering drug treatment who describe ketamine as one of their problem substances rose from 335 to 917 between 2020-21 and 2023-24, according to the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System.\nAn anonymised 2023 survey of more than 13,000 secondary schoolchildren from 185 schools across England reported 11% of 15-year-olds had been offered ketamine at some point. The same study, conducted for NHS England, suggested the use of ketamine among schoolchildren had more than doubled in the last decade from 0.4% in 2013 to 0.9% in 2023.\nGeneration K: Kids on Ketamine\nAvailable now on BBC Sounds, on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 GMT on Tuesday 25 February and at 11:00 GMT on Wednesday 26 February\nThe drug came into the spotlight following the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry aged 54, after which a coroner found ketamine had been the primary cause. Doctors and experts subsequently described how the market for the drug in the US has exploded as it has grown in popularity among Hollywood celebrities.\nAnd thousands of miles away, among ordinary young people in UK towns, ketamine \u2013 also known as special K, vitamin K, or kit kat - has also become fashionable. Although highly dangerous, it is often seen as a sociable way to get high, with users buying it in powder form and snorting it.\nKetamine gained attention after the death of Friends actor Matthew Perry, with a coroner ruling it as the primary cause\nNow, just 11 years after ketamine was reclassified from Class C to Class B, the UK government is seeking expert advice on whether to make ketamine a Class A drug. This would mean anyone supplying it could be handed a life sentence.\n'Ketamine addiction left me crying in pain'\nHooked on ketamine - Gen Z's drug of choice\nKetamine bladder: Special clinics as youth addiction 'explodes'\nBut some experts are sceptical this would make much of a difference. While ketamine use appears to be on the rise among the young, there is a sharp divide in opinion around what can be done to halt that.\n'It's in the schools, it's in the parks'\nOne Saturday afternoon in September 2023, the hottest day of the year, a 16-year-old called Preston McNally took ketamine with three friends in Burnley. High on the drug, he fell into the Leeds and Liverpool canal that flows through the town. Preston's friends had also taken the drug and did not call for help straight away, an inquest was later told.\nThe coroner said Preston drowned due to ketamine intoxication. The inquest also heard that he had told his sister he was trying to quit just before he died.\nThose on the front line are well aware of the scale of the problem. \"The amount of mums that have said to me, 'It's everywhere',\" says Fr Alex Frost from St Matthews Church in the town. He runs a support group for parents of ketamine users. \"It's in the schools, it's in the parks.\"\nAcross Lancashire, recorded offences for possession and supply of ketamine rose by nearly 70% from 54 in 2023 to 91 in 2024. \"What we have seen, probably within the last 12 months, is the upturn in the use, particularly around children,\" says Insp Matt Plummer of Lancashire Police. \"Sometimes the parents have no idea.\"\nOnce known as a party drug linked to club culture, ketamine use now appears to be shifting\nOnce ketamine was known as a party drug, associated with the club scene. But there's evidence to suggest that has changed. In a 2024 report into drug trends in Greater Manchester, school-aged children recounted how they used it with friends to \"chill\" in the local parks or at home.\nThose who go on to use it away from social settings are often doing so \"to self-medicate unmet mental health support needs such as anxiety and trauma\", says the author of the report, Robert Ralphs, a professor of criminology and social policy at Manchester Metropolitan University.\n'Everybody else is doing it'\nOne mother, who we are calling Claire, told the BBC she was oblivious to the fact that her 14-year-old daughter Lexi (not her real name) was addicted to ketamine until the teenager ended up in hospital with severe stomach cramps.\nLexi, who lives on a neat, well-cared-for street in Burnley, loved sport and dancing. But after she started secondary school, she says, a friend introduced her to ketamine.\n\"I knew it was illegal\u2026 and it was a horse tranquiliser,\" says Lexi. \"That's all I knew. I didn't really want to do it, but I just thought, well, everybody else is doing it and I didn't really want to be the odd one out.\"\nOne reason that so many young people are gravitating towards ketamine is they can buy it for pocket-money prices, according to Lexi. \"It were easy to get \u2013 like, really easy,\" she says.\nMany young people are turning to ketamine because it is affordable and easy to buy, according to Lexi\nIn Burnley, friends will chip in for the \u00a315 to \u00a330 it costs for a gram and share it.\nTo feed her habit, Lexi would ask her mum for a couple of pounds for the bus or some make-up - or sometimes she would steal a \u00a310 note. If Lexi had been coming home drunk or smelling of weed, her mother Claire would have twigged. Claire says: \"I was absolutely gobsmacked, just distraught, really, thinking: how did I not know?\"\n'You're doing stupid amounts'\nWhat makes ketamine especially dangerous is that lots of people, particularly young people, wrongly see it as a lower-risk drug, says Mrs Wilson of the WithYou charity.\nAt lower doses, she says, it has a similar effect to alcohol. \"The effects can wear off from about 40 minutes to just over an hour after taking it,\" she adds. \"If you want to keep those effects, then repeat dosing is required to continue them.\"\nAnd this means users' habits can escalate rapidly, according to Aaron (not his real name), who lives in a small town outside Burnley and took his first snort of ketamine when he was just 16.\n\"Your tolerance goes up extremely quickly and within the first month you're doing stupid amounts,\" he says. Soon he was spending \u00a3200 month on the drug.\nHigher doses can lead to a state known as a K-hole, \"which is where you become completely detached from reality and also paralysed\", says Mrs Wilson.\nThen there is the psychological impact. The WithYou charity is helping Lexi recover from dependence on the drug, but also trauma and self-harm. Once, when she was high, she was the victim of a sexual assault. When kids are on ketamine, they are extremely vulnerable.\n'Extremely dangerous'\nSome of the families of ketamine addicts the BBC has spoken to want the drug reclassified as Class A. But this would also mean children caught in possession of ketamine could face up to seven years in jail rather than five. Putting ketamine in the same bracket as heroin and cocaine \"may increase the stigma and make young people less likely to discuss their use and seek help\", warns Prof Ralphs.\nThe government is currently seeking expert advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) on whether the drug should be reclassified. \"Ketamine is an extremely dangerous substance and the recent rise in its use is deeply concerning,\" says Dame Diana Johnson, the policing minister. \"It is vital we are responding to all the latest evidence and advice to ensure people's safety and we will carefully consider the ACMD's recommendations before making any decision.\"\nFamilies in Burnley are calling for more support to tackle what Fr Frost describes as a ketamine \"epidemic\"\nFamilies in the Burnley area say the authorities also need to do more to help those suffering as a result of what Fr Frost calls an \"epidemic\" of ketamine use.\nIn response, Lancashire County Council says it is \"dedicated to supporting children and young people affected by ketamine use in our community\" and that it \"will continue to work tirelessly to address the challenges posed by ketamine use and to provide the necessary support to those in need\".\n'The urge is always there'\nThere is scepticism from those on the frontline that increased enforcement will solve the issue.\n\"It's not a case that we can just arrest our way out of the ketamine issue,\" says Insp Plummer. \"You could arrest 10, 15 people a day for the possession of ketamine if you found them, but it's not going to change the cycle, particularly with kids.\" He adds that generally children caught with ketamine are given informal words of advice and referred for support, not charged.\nAnd some experts query how effective reclassification would be.  These include Prof Ralphs, who observes that the 2014 shift from Class C to Class B has not prevented the recent rise in usage among young people. He also suggests that would have no impact on people's decisions to supply it either, as most ketamine dealers already supply Class A substances as well. He adds that reclassification \"will not deter young people from using it if their underlying mental health and wellbeing needs continue to be unmet\".\nIn the meantime, no one yet knows what the long-term effects will be for children who start taking ketamine at 12, 13 or 14. Community leaders and the families the BBC spoke to say they cannot wait for change, and that urgent action is needed now to try to prevent more young people suffering.\nLexi says she is trying to move forward with her life. Since the doctors at the hospital told Lexi where her life could be heading, she has not used ketamine.\nGetting the drug out of her head is still not easy. She insists she will never take another dose of ketamine. But, she says, \"the urge is always there for me to do it again\".\n\nIf you've been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support is available via BBC Action Line.\n\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nMore from InDepth\nThree years on, Ukraine's extinction nightmare has returned\nRace policies or Israel - what's really driving Trump's fury with South Africa?\n'Gruesome sell-out or a chance to lead': What will happen when Starmer visits Trump?\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Fellow judge Alan Carr added that she had \"trademark wit\" and delivered a \"comedy masterclass\" with her impressions of Trump, Margret Thatcher and Kim Woodburn.\nThe Vivienne went on to be a contestant in the seventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars in 2022.\nSkating to anthems by gay icons\nThe Vivienne finished third on Dancing on Ice in 2023\nIn January 2023, The Vivienne became the first drag queen to appear on Dancing on Ice and was partnered with American skater Colin Grafton.\nShe finished in third place behind gymnast Nile Wilson and Joey Essex.\nThe pair skated to songs by gay icons such as Dolly Parton and Cher and particularly excelled in the movies and musical weeks, whether performing to Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious or Don't Cry for Me Argentina.\nThe best Donald Trump impression you\u2019ll probably ever see\nMan sentenced for homophobic attack on The Vivienne\nHer jaw-dropping ability to skate perfectly from day one meant not only did she never appear in the bottom two, but she also never appeared lower than third on the leader board.\nBut it was the week five performance that struck a chord with many as James chose not to perform in drag for the first time, confessing that it made him emotional dancing to Beyonce's Halo \"without my armour\".\nJames was widely praised for their decision, with one person on X saying that \"'The Vivienne skating as James and not in drag in itself is inspiring\".\nChannelling the Wicked Witch of the West\nThe Vivienne has channelled the Wicked Witch of the West on stage and off\nWilliams starred in a number of theatre shows, most recently in a role that seemed to be the perfect fit - the misunderstood yet strong and compassionate Wicked Witch of the West in the revival of The Wizard of Oz musical.\nStarring alongside Aston Merrygold in the UK and Ireland tour, the performer reprised the role in the West End at the Gillian Lynne Theatre last year.\n\"I don't have many words to say as this is one huge dream,\" they wrote on Instagram. \"Dream big kids.\"\nThe Vivienne channelled her Wicked Witch of the West role off-stage in November when she sent heads spinning in her emerald green sequined gown at the European premiere of the Wicked film.\nMost recently, she was performing as the Childcatcher on the tour of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and performed just a week ago in Blackpool.\nTV appearances\nThe Vivienne went on to be a contestant in the seventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars in 2022\nWhile The Wizard of Oz was The Vivienne's first theatre role, she was no stranger to TV and was able to successfully build a career in television after RuPaul's Drag Race, appearing in a range of programmes including Hunted, Emmerdale and the Great British Sewing Bee.\nOver Christmas, The Vivienne appeared on a celebrity special of BBC's Blankety Blank.\nIn 2020, the Vivienne starred in a six-part series The Vivienne Takes on Hollywood on BBC Three.\nThe show saw the drag queen document her travels to Los Angeles in order to make a music video and was complete with her classic Northern humour and zingy one-liners.\nNot all drag race contestants and winners have been able to build such a successful brand around themselves despite their humour and flawless looks, which is testament to how The Vivienne's personality shone through in all her work.\nThis video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n'Now I've got a crown': The Vivienne reacts to RuPaul's Drag Race UK win in 2019\nRelated topics",

        "contents": "Artwork: The experiment will orbit the Earth for three hours before returning to Earth and splashing down off the coast of Portugal\nSteak, mashed potatoes and deserts for astronauts could soon be grown from individual cells in space if an experiment launched into orbit today is successful.\nA European Space Agency (ESA) project is assessing the viability of growing so-called lab-grown food in the low gravity and higher radiation in orbit and on other worlds.\nESA is funding the research to explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut, which can cost up to \u00a320,000 per day.\nThe team involved say the experiment is a first step to developing a small pilot food production plant on the International Space Station in two years' time.\nLab-grown food will be essential if Nasa's objective of making humanity a multi-planetary species were to be realised, claims Dr Aqeel Shamsul, CEO and founder of Bedford-based Frontier Space, which is developing the concept with researchers at Imperial College, London.\n\"Our dream is to have factories in orbit and on the Moon,\" he told BBC News.\n\"We need to build manufacturing facilities off world if we are to provide the infrastructure to enable humans to live and work in space\".\nAstronauts enjoy eating in zero gravity, but the freeze-dried food itself is not much fun to eat\nLab-grown food involves growing food ingredients, such as protein, fat and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats and then processing them to make them look and taste like normal food.\nLab-grown chicken is already on sale in the US and Singapore and lab grown steak is awaiting approval in the UK and Israel. On Earth, there are claimed environmental benefits for the technology over traditional agricultural food production methods, such as less land use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. But in space the primary driver is to reduce costs.\nThe researchers are doing the experiment because it costs so much to send astronauts food on the ISS - up to \u00a320,000 per astronaut per day, they estimate.\nNasa, other space agencies and private sector firms plan to have a long-term presence on the Moon, in orbiting space stations and maybe one day on Mars. That will mean sending up food for tens and eventually hundreds of astronauts living and working in space \u2013 something that would be prohibitively expensive if it were sent up by rockets, according to Dr Shamsul.\nGrowing food in space would make much more sense, he suggests.\n\"We could start off simply with protein-enhanced mashed potatoes on to more complex foods which we could put together in space,\" he tells me.\n\"But in the longer term we could put the lab-grown ingredients into a 3D printer and print off whatever you want on the space station, such as a steak!\"\nLab-grown steak can be produced on Earth, but can it be created in space?\nThis sounds like the replicator machines on Star Trek, which are able to produce food and drink from pure energy. But it is no longer the stuff of science fiction, says Dr Shamsul.\nHe showed me a set-up, called a bioreactor, at Imperial College's Bezos Centre for Sustainable Proteins in west London. It comprised a brick-coloured concoction bubbling away in a test tube. The process is known as precision fermentation, which is like the fermentation used to make beer, but different: \"precision\" is a rebranding word for genetically engineered.\nIn this case a gene has been added to yeast to produce extra vitamins, but all sorts of ingredients can be produced in this way, according to Dr Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro, Director of the Bezos Centre.\n\"We can make all the elements to make food,\" says Dr Ledesma-Amaro proudly.\n\"We can make proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fibres and they can be combined to make different dishes.\"\nThe brick-coloured \"food\" is grown in a small biorector, a mini-version of which has been sent into space\nA much smaller, simpler version of the biorector has been sent into space on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as part of the ESA mission. There is plenty of evidence that foods can be successfully grown from cells on Earth, but can the process be repeated in the weightlessness and higher radiation of space?\nDrs Ledesma-Amaro and Shamsul have sent small amounts of the yeast concoction to orbit the Earth in a small cube satellite on board Europe's first commercial returnable spacecraft, Phoenix. If all goes to plan, it will orbit the Earth for around three hours before falling back to Earth off the coast of Portugal. The experiment will be retrieved by a recovery vessel and sent back to the lab in London to be examined.\nThe data they gather will inform the construction of a larger, better bioreactor which the scientists will send into space next year, according to Dr Ledesma-Amaro.\nThe problem, though, is that the brick-coloured goo, which is dried into a powder, looks distinctly unappetising \u2013 even less appetising than the freeze-dried fare that astronauts currently have to put up with.\nThat is where Imperial College's master chef comes in. Jakub Radzikowski is the culinary education designer tasked with turning chemistry into cuisine.\nImperial College's master chef has the job of making lab-grown chemicals into delicious dishes\nHe isn't allowed to use lab grown ingredients to make dishes for people just yet, because regulatory approval is still pending. But he's getting a head start. For now, instead of lab-grown ingredients, Jakub is using starches and proteins from naturally occurring fungi to develop his recipes. He tells me all sorts of dishes will be possible, once he gets the go-ahead to use lab-grown ingredients.\n\"We want to create food that is familiar to astronauts who are from different parts of the world so that it can provide comfort.\n\"We can create anything from French, Chinese, Indian. It will be possible to replicate any kind of cuisine in space.\"\nToday, Jakub is trying out a new recipe of spicy dumplings and dipping sauce. He tells me that I am allowed to try them out, but taster-in-chief is someone far more qualified: Helen Sharman, the UK's first astronaut, who also has a PhD in chemistry.\nBritain's first astronaut, Helen Sharman, and I taste test what might be the space food of the future\nWe tasted the steaming dumplings together.\nMy view: \"They are absolutely gorgeous!\"\nDr Sharman's expert view, not dissimilar: \"You get a really strong blast from the flavour. It is really delicious and very moreish,\" she beamed.\n\"I would love to have had something like this. When I was in space, I had really long-life stuff: tins, freeze dried packets, tubes of stuff. It was fine, but not tasty.\"\nDr Sharman's more important observation was about the science. Lab-grown food, she said, could potentially be better for astronauts, as well as reduce costs to the levels required to make long-term off-world habitation viable.\nResearch on the ISS has shown that the biochemistry of astronauts' bodies changes during long duration space missions: their hormone balance and iron levels alter, and they lose calcium from their bones. Astronauts take supplements to compensate, but lab-grown food could in principle be tweaked with the extra ingredients already built in, says Dr Sharman.\n\"Astronauts tend to lose weight because they are not eating as much because they don't have the variety and interest in their diet,\" she told me.\n\"So, astronauts might be more open to having something that has been cooked from scratch and a feeling that you are really eating wholesome food.\"\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

Police forces across the country should be focussed on solving real crimes, not policing social media posts.\"\nThe BBC has approached the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party for comment.\nPolicing and crime are among the issues political parties have been campaigning on ahead of next week's local elections in England.\nIn an interview with the BBC, Badenoch said the Tories were bracing for a tough set of results.\nShe defended her leadership of the Conservatives and insisted she would not be swayed by internal criticism about the amount of policy she had announced so far.\n\"It's really important that we take time to get things right - rebuild trust with the public and have a credible offer,\" Badenoch said.\nPOSTCODE LOOKUP: Check if there is an election in your area\nSIMPLE GUIDE: Everything you need to know about the local elections\nGET IN TOUCH: Tell us the election issues that matter to you\nFULL COVERAGE: Catch up on all our election stories\nRelated topics",

        "title": "New Israel-Gaza ceasefire plan proposed, Hamas source tells BBC",
        "contents": "The last ceasefire ended when Israel resumed bombing last month\nA senior Palestinian official familiar with Israel-Hamas ceasefire negotiations has told the BBC that Qatari and Egyptian mediators have proposed a new formula to end the war in Gaza.\nAccording to the official, it envisages a truce lasting between five and seven years, the release of all Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, a formal end to the war, and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.\nA senior Hamas delegation was due to arrive in Cairo for consultations.\nThe last ceasefire collapsed a month ago when Israel resumed bombing Gaza, with both sides blaming each other for the failure to keep it going.\nIsrael has not commented on the mediators' plan.\nMeanwhile, 22 Palestinians have been killed in a series of Israeli air strikes across the Gaza Strip since Monday evening, a medical official in the Hamas-run health ministry told the BBC.\nThe official said they were killed in Khan Younis, Jabalia, Beit Lahia, and Gaza City, and that 45 other people were injured.\nLocal residents and eyewitnesses described the air strikes as \"extremely intense.\"\nAccording to witnesses, the attacks destroyed dozens of bulldozers and heavy machinery - equipment used by Hamas-run municipalities to reopen roads, clear rubble, and rescue victims trapped beneath the debris.\nTanks have also been seen moving in the southern part of Rafah city in the south of Gaza.\nAs Israel pushes on with its offensive, talks will take place in Cairo with Hamas represented at a senior level by the head of its political council, Mohammed Darwish, and its lead negotiator Khalil al-Hayya.\nThe meeting comes days after the movement rejected Israel's latest proposal, which included a demand for Hamas to disarm in return for a six-week truce.\nOn Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not end the war before Hamas was destroyed and all the hostages returned. Hamas has demanded Israel commit to ending the war before the hostages are freed.\nThe Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC that Hamas has signalled its readiness to hand over governance of Gaza to any Palestinian entity agreed upon \"at the national and regional level\". The official said this could be the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA) or a newly formed administrative body.\nNetanyahu has ruled out any role for the PA in the future governance of Gaza, which has been ruled by Hamas since 2007.\nWhile it is still too early to assess the likelihood of success, the source described the current mediation effort as serious and said Hamas had shown \"unprecedented flexibility\".\nHamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking 251 back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military offensive in response, which has killed 51,240 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry figures on Monday.\nElsewhere, the Palestinian Embassy in Cairo has instructed its staff - who had been co-ordinating medical evacuations from Gaza to Egyptian hospitals and facilitating the entry of humanitarian aid - to relocate with their families to the Egyptian city of Arish, near the Gaza border.\nRelated topics\nMore on this story\nIsrael and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explained\nWhy are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza?\nIs the war starting again in Gaza?",

        "title": "Is the war starting again in Gaza?",
        "contents": "Israel carried out air strikes across Gaza after two months of truce\nA ceasefire which had halted fighting between Israel and Hamas for two months appears to be over following an intense wave of air strikes by Israel on what it said were Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip.\nThe ceasefire laid out a path for permanently ending the war, and had seen the release of hostages held by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.\nThe war was triggered when Hamas attacked on Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 back to Gaza as captives.\nIsrael responded with a massive military offensive, which killed more than 48,500 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says.\nWhy has Israel launched air strikes?\nIsraeli aircraft began attacking what the military said were Hamas targets across Gaza in the early hours of 18 March. It was the most extensive series of air strikes since the ceasefire began on 19 January.\nThe Israeli military described the action as \"pre-emptive strikes... based on Hamas's readiness to execute terror attacks, build up force and re-arm\". At the same time, the Israeli prime minister's office said the action was ordered after Hamas's \"repeated refusal to release our hostages\" and its rejection of new ceasefire proposals by the US and mediators.\nHamas reacted furiously, accusing Israel of having \"decided to overturn the ceasefire agreement\".\nThe ceasefire has been under increasing strain for several weeks during which time indirect talks between Israel and Hamas about moving forward had reached an impasse.\nIs the ceasefire over?\nIt has not been declared over, though in practice the attacks by Israel mean the truce is no longer.\nMediators though - the US, Qatar and Egypt - which spent months brokering the ceasefire will almost certainly intensify efforts to salvage the agreement.\nIsrael, however, has warned its new offensive will \"continue as long as necessary, and will expand beyond air strikes\" - suggesting plans for renewed military action on the ground.\nThe Israeli prime minister's office said the attacks that begun on 18 March were being carried out \"in order to achieve the objectives of the war\". These have previously been declared as:\nThe return of all the hostages\nThe dismantling of Hamas's governing and military capabilities\nThe removal of any future threat from Gaza\nIt is unclear, though, whether the statement means the military action will continue until such aims have been met, or whether it is part of a strategy to force Hamas to accept new ceasefire demands.\nAlthough there was no fighting when Israel began its large-scale air attacks, both sides had repeatedly accused the other of breaking the ceasefire. It also happened at a time when the first phase of the ceasefire had expired and the second not yet begun.\nIsrael said it accepted new US plans to keep the ceasefire going, but Hamas said the  proposals were unacceptable because it was not what had been agreed upon in the original truce.\nWhat does the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas say?\nThe ceasefire was announced on 15 January and began four days later, after months of negotiations led by the US, Qatar and Egypt. It is based on a proposal set out by former US President Joe Biden in May 2024.\nThe deal involves three stages:\nStage one\nThis officially lasted for 42 days, during which:\nHamas released 25 living Israeli hostages and eight dead hostages\nIsrael released about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza\nIsraeli forces left populated areas of Gaza\nDisplaced Palestinians returned to their neighbourhoods\nHundreds of aid lorries were allowed into Gaza each day\nIsraeli troops remained in Gaza's border areas, including the southern Philadelphi Corridor, and left the Netzarim Corridor, a military zone cutting off the north of Gaza from the south\nStage two\nNegotiations on the second stage were meant to begin 16 days after the start of stage one - but this did not happen. Like stage one, stage two is also meant to be completed within 42 days.\nAccording to the ceasefire deal, under stage two:\nA permanent ceasefire will be established\nRemaining living hostages in Gaza will be exchanged for more Palestinian prisoners\nIsraeli forces will make a complete withdrawal\nStage three\nThe final part of the agreement would see:\nThe return of all remaining bodies of dead hostages\nThe reconstruction of Gaza, which is expected to take years\nIsrael and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explained\nWhy Israel and Hamas have been fighting in Gaza\nHow 15 months of war has devastated Gaza\nWhy hasn't the ceasefire moved forward?\nSince 1 March, when stage one expired, the ceasefire has been in limbo.\nStage two has not begun, even though talks were meant to have started weeks ago.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on 2 March that Israel had accepted a plan by US envoy Steve Witkoff \"to extend the temporary ceasefire by 50 days\" to discuss the second stage.\nNetanyahu said that under the plan, half of the remaining hostages would be released straight away, and the remainder released if an agreement was reached.\nHamas said it rejected Israel's attempt to extend the first stage, calling it \"a blatant attempt to evade the agreement and avoid entering into negotiations for the second phase\".\nThe US - which has aligned itself more closely with Israel since Donald Trump succeeded Joe Biden - said Hamas was \"making a very bad bet that time is on its side. It is not.\"\nHow many hostages are still held in Gaza?\nIsrael says 59 hostages are still being held in Gaza, up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive and at least 35 are presumed dead.\nThe 25 Israeli hostages released under the deal included female Israeli soldiers, male and female Israeli civilians, and two children. Five living Thai hostages were also freed outside of the deal.\nThe living hostages were released by Hamas in stage-managed events in different locations in Gaza, where they were handed over to the Red Cross.\nBritish-Israeli hostage Emily Damari (right) was among those freed under the ceasefire\nThe Red Cross then transferred them to Israeli forces inside Gaza, before they were driven across the border into Israel and reunited with their families. The freed hostages were then flown to hospitals for medical checks.\nThe bodies of four hostages were also handed over in a spectacle condemned by Israel and others. Four other bodies were returned without a similar event.\nBBC Verify: What we can tell from Hamas hostage handover video\nWho are the released and rescued hostages?\nHow historic deal was sealed with 10 minutes to spare\nWho are the Palestinian prisoners freed by Israel?\nAround 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza were released in the first phase of the deal.\nMany of those released in the first exchange, and some in the following three exchanges, had never been charged and were detained without trial in Israeli prisons under what is called \"administrative detention\", a process widely criticised by human rights groups.\nOthers had been found guilty of serious crimes, including being convicted by Israeli courts of multiple murders. Dozens had been serving life sentences.\nThe released prisoners have returned to the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, and in some cases, Gaza. Dozens were deported abroad due to the gravity of their crimes.\nIsrael has insisted that no-one who was involved in the 7 October attacks will be freed.\nPrisoners have been returned to the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, and some have been deported\nThe prisoners are among more than 10,000 Palestinians held by Israel (not including detainees from Gaza held by the Israeli military) who have either been convicted, or are suspected of \"security\" offences.\nThese range from bombings and other attacks, to belonging to banned armed groups.\nMore than 3,000 people are reported to be held under administrative detention.\nFreed Palestinian prisoner welcomes ceasefire deal\nHow has aid been delivered to Gaza?\nIsrael says 4,200 lorries carrying aid have entered Gaza each week since the ceasefire was agreed in mid-January.\nHalf of the supplies were destined for the north of Gaza, where aid had been hardest to deliver and food security experts had been warning of imminent famine.\nBut from 2 March, Israel stopped supplies being allowed into the territory.\nArab states and the UN condemned Israel's actions as a violation of the ceasefire agreement and against international law.\nAid agencies have managed to store supplies, which means there is no immediate danger to the civilian population. But the longer the ban lasts, the greater the pressure on making supplies last.\nGaza is home to an estimated 2.1 million Palestinians, almost all of whom had to leave their homes as Israel carried out continuous strikes across the territory and issued mass evacuation orders for large residential areas.\nHundreds of thousands of Gazans have returned home, but in many cases there is nothing to go back to, with whole streets and neighbourhoods standing in ruin.\nSome 60% to 70% of buildings are estimated to have been damaged or destroyed.\nThe process is also fraught with danger, with Israeli and Hamas forces at a tense standoff, risks of unexploded ordnance, and warnings from the Israeli military to civilians to stay clear of military positions.\nRebuilding Gaza will be a monumental task. The UN has estimated it will cost at least $53bn (\u00a341bn; \u20ac48.5bn), and it is likely to take decades.\nThe human cost of the conflict will also be felt for many years to come, with tens of thousands wounded and left with complex psychological damage.\nRelated topics",

        "contents": "This video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nWatch: 'It's not right' - Students react to Trump freezing Harvard's federal funding\nHarvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration claiming that its freezing of federal grants worth billions of dollars is unlawful.\nIts president, Alan M Garber, announced the action on Monday in a letter to the university community which said the $2bn funding freeze would hamper critical disease research.\nHarvard, the world's richest university, last week rejected a list of demands that the Trump administration said was designed to curb diversity initiatives and fight anti-semitism at the school.\nIn response to the lawsuit, the White House said the \"gravy train of federal assistance\" was coming to an end.\nFunding cuts have also been implemented at other elite universities, and a new government anti-semitism task force has identified at least 60 universities for review.\nPresident Donald Trump has accused universities of failing to protect Jewish students during last year's campus protests against the war in Gaza and US support for Israel.\nHarvard has stood up to Trump. How long can it last?\nIn Monday's letter, Mr Garber said: \"The consequences of the government's overreach will be severe and long-lasting.\"\nStudies on pediatric cancer, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease would be affected, he wrote.\n\"In recent weeks, the federal government has launched a broad attack on the critical funding partnerships that make this invaluable research possible,\" the school's lawsuit said.\nIt said the withholding of federal funding violated Harvard's constitutional rights and was being used as \"leverage to gain control of academic decisionmaking at Harvard\".\nThe Trump administration has signalled that another $1bn of federal funding could be suspended. Harvard receives about $9bn in total annually, which is mostly spent on research.\nHarvard's tax exemption status and its ability to enroll international students could also be under threat.\nMr Garber, who is Jewish, acknowledged Harvard's campus, located in Massachusetts, has had issues with anti-semitism but said he had established task forces aimed at the problem.\nHe said the university would release the report of two task forces that looked into anti-semitism and anti-Muslim bias.\nSeparately, the Trump administration has targeted other private Ivy League institutions including suspending $1bn at Cornell University and $510 million at Brown University. Federal dollars also play an outsized role there in funding new scientific breakthroughs.\nOthers such as Columbia University, the epicentre of pro-Palestinian campus protests last year, have agreed to some demands after $400 million of federal funds was threatened.\nThe demands to Harvard included agreeing to government-approved external audits of the university's curriculum as well as hiring and admission data.\nIn response, Harvard released a blistering letter rejecting what it described as a \"takeover\" by the federal government.\nFormer US President Barack Obama, a Harvard alum, has said he supported the university, calling the cash freeze unlawful.\nThe White House responded Monday night in a statement.\n\"The gravy train of federal assistance to institutions like Harvard, which enrich their grossly overpaid bureaucrats with tax dollars from struggling American families is coming to an end.\n\"Taxpayer funds are a privilege, and Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions required to access that privilege.\"\nPolling by Gallup last summer suggested that confidence in higher education had been falling over time among Americans of all political backgrounds.\nThat was partly driven, the survey said, by a growing belief that universities push a political agenda. The decline was particularly steep among Republicans.\nFollow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

        "title": "Harvard just stood up to Trump. How long can it last?",
        "contents": "This video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nWatch: 'It's not right' - Students react to Trump freezing Harvard's federal funding\nHarvard University says it will not acquiesce to US President Donald Trump's demands - whether it continues to get federal funding or not.\n\"No government - regardless of which party is in power - should dictate what private universities can teach,\" Harvard's president Alan Garber said in a letter posted on the university's website.\nNot long after Harvard refused to agree to the White House's sweeping list of demands - which included directions on how to govern, hire and teach - the Trump administration froze $2.2bn (\u00a31.7bn) of federal funds to the institution.\n\"Everyone knows that Harvard has 'lost its way,'\" Donald Trump wrote on social media on Wednesday morning. \"Harvard is a JOKE, teaches Hate and Stupidity, and should no longer receive Federal Funds.\"\nMany students and alumni lauded the university's decision to stand its ground, despite the consequences. Former President Barack Obama, an alumnus himself, called Trump's move \"ham-handed\" and praised Harvard as \"an example for other higher-ed institutions\".\nIn response to Harvard's decision to refuse the government's demands, the education department accused the university of a \"troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities and colleges \u2013 that federal investment does not come with the responsibility to uphold civil rights laws\".\nWith billions in the balance, the battle for the higher ground in the case of Harvard may just be the opening salvo in a war of attrition between the federal government and higher education.\nObama calls Trump's freeze of Harvard funding 'unlawful'\nTrump's attacks on Harvard are not isolated - the government's antisemitism task force has identified at least 60 universities for review.\nNor did the latest move come out of the blue. Trump and his Vice-President JD Vance have long railed against higher education institutions. In 2021, Vance gave a speech that described universities as the \"enemy\".\nTrump pitched a funding crackdown on universities in his presidential campaign, painting them as hostile to conservatives. Almost a year before the present conflict in Gaza began in October 2023, he introduced a free speech policy initiative that promised to \"shatter the left-wing censorship regime\" - in part targeting campuses.\nPolling by Gallup last summer suggested that confidence in higher education had been falling over time among Americans of all political backgrounds, partly driven by a growing belief that universities push a political agenda. The decline was particularly steep among Republicans.\nAt issue now, Trump's team says, is last year's pro-Palestinian campus protests, which roiled colleges across the country. During the demonstrations and sit-ins, some Jewish students said they felt unsafe and faced harassment. Others joined the protests against Israel's military action in Gaza and US support for it.\nLast month, Columbia University agreed to many of the administration's demands in the wake of the protests - after the government cut $400m in funding.\nHarvard, too, made concessions.  It agreed to engage with the administration's task force to combat antisemitism. The school dismissed the leaders of its Center for Middle Eastern Studies and suspended its Religion, Conflict, and Peace Initiative over accusations of anti-Israel bias.\nAnd in January, Harvard settled two lawsuits brought by Jewish students alleging antisemitism. It did not admit any wrongdoing, and said the settlement showed its commitment to supporting its Jewish students and staff.\nBut the university drew the line at the White House's list of demands on Friday.\nHarvard student Sa'maia Evans, who is an activist and member of the university's African and African American Resistance Organization, said the university's decision to take a stand was a long time coming.\n\"Harvard will only do that of which it is held accountable to,\" she told the BBC. She pointed to campus protests in the past few weeks - and the widespread criticism of Columbia's agreement with the Trump administration - as helping to put pressure on university officials.\n\"They know the public - they would experience public backlash\" if they capitulated, Ms Evans said.\n\"It would be atypical (for) Harvard to do anything outside of what would be in its own interest.\"\nWith a $53.2bn endowment - a figure that is larger than the GDP of some small countries - Harvard is uniquely able to weather the storm. But experts say it is still left in a crunch.\n\"Most policymakers think of endowments as a chequing account, a debit card where you can withdraw money and use it for any purpose,\" said Steven Bloom, the spokesperson for American Council on Education. \"But it's not.\"\nWhile Harvard's endowment is eye-popping, it says 70% of the money is earmarked for specific projects - which is typical for educational endowments, according to Mr Bloom.\nHarvard has to spend the money the way the donors have directed, or it risks legal liability.\nAnd Harvard's expenses are huge - its 2024 operating budget was $6.4bn. About a third of that was funded by the endowment - with 16% coming from the federal government, often to help with things that are supposed to create good for the whole of the US, such as biomedical research.\nMr Bloom said the golden rule for endowment finance was that universities should not spend more than 5% of their total endowment each year. Making up for a $2bn loss means the school will need to boost its endowment by $40bn.\n\"You can't find 40 billion dollars under a rock,\" Mr Bloom said.\nAnd that pain will only increase if Trump is able to make good on his threat to remove Harvard's tax-exempt status. That status helps the school avoid paying taxes on its investments and properties. Harvard has campuses all over the Greater Boston area, and is estimated by Bloomberg to have saved $158m on its property tax bills in 2023.\nIn his latest comments on the university, early on Wednesday, Trump attacked the \"radical left\" Harvard leadership and said the institution could \"no longer be considered even a decent place of learning\".\nTrump threatens Harvard's tax-exempt status after freezing $2bn funding\nThe realities of the situation have made some students sceptical about how long it can go on.\n\"There's more the government can do if it wants to attack Harvard, and I'm not optimistic that it's going to stop after cutting $2.2 billion,\" Matthew Tobin, the academic representative on Harvard's student council.\nMr Tobin said the idea that the Trump administration was making these demands to help Harvard is \"malarkey\".\n\"Its a total bad-faith attack,\" he told the BBC. \"The funding cuts have to do with Trump attacking an institution that he views as liberal, and wanting to exercise more control over what people teach and how students learn and think.\"\nWith additional reporting from Isabella Bull in London\nRelated topics",

        "contents": "Services have been held in Costa Rica and elsewhere around the world to mark the Pope's death\nFrom the Vatican to the Philippines, Catholics are spending their Easter Monday saying goodbye to their spiritual leader Pope Francis.\nHis death comes at one of the most important times of the year for followers of the Roman Catholic Church, and less than 24 hours after the ailing Pope addressed worshipers in St Peter's Square on Easter Sunday.\nThat timing is not lost on Catholics.\n\"He [God] chose the most beautiful day for the Christian Church - he couldn't have chosen a better day,\" said Father Sergio Codera, a Salesian priest from Spain.\nHe continued: \"It [Easter] is the most important occasion Christians celebrate, when we celebrate that death does not have the final word.\n\"And it has been this day that God has chosen for Pope Francis to meet him.\"\nMourners poured into St Peter's Square in the Vatican to pay their respects to the late Pope\nIn the Vatican, there is shock from those who saw Francis perform his final public duty.\n\"It was very shocking - we just saw him yesterday for the Easter celebration and we received a blessing,\" one man in St Peter's Square told the BBC.\nOne woman who heard his address said: \"He took his duty to the people so seriously - even when he was so unwell yesterday, he still came out, he was still part of the Easter mass, he still got to speak to us.\"\nChurch bells have been ringing out across Manila, the capital of the Philippines, where worshippers have gathered in churches to pray and reflect on the Pope's death.\nLIVE UPDATES: Pope Francis dies aged 88\nANALYSIS: The Pope from Latin America who changed Catholic Church\nEXPLAINER: What next after the death of Pope Francis?\nWATCH: The pontiff's last public appearance on Easter Sunday\nIN PICTURES: Defining images of the first Latin American pope\nAround 85% of the nation's population of 110 million are Roman Catholic, making it the church's stronghold in Asia.\nAmong them is Jude Aquino, an altar server who reflected on the Pope's influence on young Catholics shortly after his death was confirmed.\nHe told Reuters news agency: \"It's a big hit against the Catholic Church because for the youth like us, he's such a big role model  - a role model whom we follow since he's a vicar of Christ.\"\nWorshippers gathered at Baclaran Church in Paranaque, Metro Manila, to pay their respects to the late Pope\nCatholics in rebel-held Bukavu, a city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, have gathered at Notre-Dame de la Paix Cathedral to mourn.\nAround half of DR Congo's population is Catholic, the largest such community in Africa.\nFrancis addressed half a million worshipers in the capital Kinshasa in 2023, becoming the first Pope to visit the conflict-ridden country in more than three decades. During his final address on Easter Sunday, the pope called for an end to violence in the country.\n\"Pope Francis was a pope who loved our country, the DRC, very much,\" Sifa Albertina said outside the cathedral.\n\"He even decided to come to DRC despite his health condition, to meet the Congolese people and share their difficulties.\n\"I saw him come to Congo. May God welcome his soul, because the pope really cared about us.\"\nPope Francis was the first pope to visit the DRC in 37 years when he visited in 2023\nSeven days of mourning have been declared in Brazil, which is home to the largest Catholic population in the world.\nSpeaking outside the Church of our Lady of Lourdes in Rio de Janeiro, worshipper Rosane Ribeiro said: \"I thought he was a unique and extraordinary person, also during [the pandemic].\n\"As a priest, he got up every day to pray for the world... and died at a marvellous and beautiful time [Easter], worthy of him.\"\nDuring his time as Pope, Francis faced criticism at times over his handling of child sex abuse scandals, but was praised by some for speaking with victims and putting in place new rules to hold clergy to account.\nJuan Carlos Cruz Chellew, who was abused by a cleric in Chile when he was a boy, said one of the few people in the Church willing to listen to him was Pope Francis.\nAttendees packed into the Catedral da Se in S\u00e3o Paulo on Monday to mark the occasion\nHe said the Pope became \"a real father to me\" and changed the Church's attitudes to sexual abuse.\nSpeaking to the BBC's Newshour programme, he continued: \"He realised he had made a mistake, he was ill-informed, so he invited me and two friends to come over and I spent a week with him in Santa Marta [the Pope's Vatican residence] and he and I talked long hours about the situation.\n\"And ever since he started changing the attitude towards sexual abuse in the church - he was an extraordinary person.\n\"It was incredible to feel listened to... through the years I've told him I feel like Lazarus: you were dead, nobody hears you, nobody cares, and suddenly the most important person does care, and sincerely cares, and makes a big change.\"\nAt Mexico City's Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, mass was held in the Pope's memory\nThe faithful arrived in droves at Mexico City's main religious centre, the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, to attend a mass for the pontiff and hear the bells ring out in his name - an act which was repeated in churches across Mexico.\nSome arrived at the church on their knees, dragging their bodies to the church door in an act of contrition and suffering among the most devout.\nOthers simply stood with their heads bowed in quiet remembrance of a man who had stood with Mexico's poorest, including its migrants and victims of violence, on numerous occasions.\n\"He led us by the hand, and he will always be in our hearts\", Jonathan Solis told the BBC, speaking in hushed tones at the back of the church.\nHe had brought his daughter with him to pay their respects as a family, he said, and underlined that it was a source of great pride to have a Latin American Pope.\n\"He was so important to Latinos. We can never forget him. That's why so many families have turned out, like him - with their hearts on their sleeves - to support each other through this difficult moment.\"\nElsewhere, mourners gathered for mass at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston, a US city sometimes dubbed the most Catholic in the country.\nMary, 70, and Tom, 71, were visiting from Chicago when they learned of the Pope's death and made their way to the cathedral to pray for him.\n\"He was just such a wonderful man, so human, like a normal person - you feel like you could be his friend almost,\" Mary said.\nIn Spain, where Catholics make up more than half of the population, three days of national mourning have been declared.\nNuria Ortega, a civil servant from Madrid, said: \"I think he was a person that was accepted by all by Catholic and [non] Catholics and I think he was a person that was open to dialogue.\"\nAs the search for a successor to Francis began, student Javier Herratia said the church must become more \"humble\" and appeal to a young generation.\nHe continued: \"We will have faith in the Holy Spirit and hope that the next Pope is as good as the rest.\"\nAdditional reporting by Will Grant in Mexico City and Alice Hutton in Boston\nRelated topics",

        "title": "Francis was a vocal critic of the powerful, his influence felt far beyond faith",
        "contents": "Francis was a vocal critic of the powerful, his influence felt far beyond faith\nOver 12 profoundly consequential years for the Catholic Church, Pope Francis steered it into uncharted territory and did so in ways that will resonate long into the future.\nThe pontiff worked to soften the face of the Catholic Church for many, loosened the Vatican's grip on power and intervened in some of the major social questions of our time.\nWithin Catholicism, he certainly had his critics; some traditionalists in particular were often enraged by actions they felt were a radical departure from Church teaching.\nDespite him being a vocal pacifist and critic of actions by major nations that he perceived as harmful, there were also those who felt he should have been more progressive.\nBut from the moment he was elected in 2013, Pope Francis came with an informality and a smile that put the people he met at their ease. It was symbolic of a principle that guided his belief that the Church should reach people in their daily lives, wherever in the world they happened to be.\n\"At the beginning of my papacy I had the feeling that it would be brief: no more than three or four years, I thought,\" Pope Francis said in his autobiography Hope, released in January 2025, a book that gives us insight into the Pope's own reflections on his legacy.\nOne of his first acts as pope was to give up the papal apartment on the third floor of the Apostolic Palace, instead choosing to live in the same guesthouse in which he had stayed as a cardinal.\nSome saw this as a sign he was giving up the ostentatious trappings of papacy, and of the humility he would certainly become known for - he had, after all, taken the name of a saint who championed the cause of the poor.\nBut the main reason for surrendering the papal apartment, as he later explained it, pointed to another of his characteristics: that he loved being around people.\nTo him, the apartment felt detached and a difficult place in which to welcome guests. At the guesthouse he was surrounded by clergy and rarely alone for long.\nOn foreign trips to more than 60 countries, in his audiences at the Vatican and during countless events, it was very clear that being close to people, and particularly the young, was his lifeblood.\nPope Francis' influence was felt far and wide\nSocial issues and 'imperfect Catholics'\nWithin Catholicism, he signalled a radical change in tone on some social issues.\n\"Everyone in the Church is invited, including people who are divorced, including people who are homosexual, including people who are transgender,\" he wrote in his autobiography.\nGiven that the Church did not recognise divorce in its canon law and that previous popes had talked of homosexuality as a disorder not \"a human fact\", as Pope Francis did, this was a departure that again concerned traditionalists.\nBut the Pope appeared to want the Church to explore and understand people's every day struggles in a fresh light. He acknowledged his own journey in seeing things differently to the way he had done in the past.\nLIVE UPDATES: Pope Francis dies aged 88\nANALYSIS: The Pope from Latin America who changed Catholic Church\nEXPLAINER: How the next pope is chosen\nWATCH: The pontiff's last public appearance on Easter Sunday\nIN PICTURES: Defining images of the first Latin American pope\nProgressives welcomed the Pope's compassion for what he called \"imperfect Catholics\", but there was also a recognition more broadly that words of acceptance from a pontiff could have an effect on those outside the Church too.\n\"The first time that a group of transgender people came to the Vatican, they left in tears, moved because I had taken their hands, had kissed them... as if I had done something exceptional for them! But they are daughters of God,\" he wrote in Hope.\nPope Francis roundly condemned countries that consider homosexuality a crime, and he talked of divorce sometimes being \"morally necessary\", citing cases of domestic abuse.\nHowever, there are those who suggest the Pope could have gone further to encourage change in Church teaching.\nHomosexual \"acts\" remain a sin in Catholicism, marriage can still only be between a man and a woman, divorce is still not officially recognised and the Pope himself remained very firmly against gender reassignment and surrogacy.\nThroughout his papacy, and long before that, Pope Francis also always remained firm in his own belief that women should not be priests.\nHe did however describe the Church as \"female\" and encouraged parishes around the world to find more leadership roles for women in ways that were consistent with the Catholic teaching that does not currently allow women to be ordained.\nIn 2021 Sister Raffaella Petrini was appointed secretary general of the papal state and under Pope Francis the Vatican did start an ongoing process of exploring whether women could take up the role of deacon, assisting in worship services.\nSister Raffaella Petrini seen alongside a cardinal\nNevertheless, some reformists were left disappointed that more progress was not made regarding equality for women, in a faith where the majority of churchgoers are women.\nDuring the latter part of his papacy, the Pope launched an ambitious three-year consultation process aimed at gauging the opinion of as many of the world's more-than-a-billion Catholics as possible.\nThere were tens of thousands of listening sessions across the globe, meant to tease out the issues that Catholics most cared about. It transpired that roles for women and ways in which the Church could become more inclusive to LGBT+ Catholics were high on the list.\nWhile the process itself did not lead to decisive action on either front, it did speak volumes about Pope Francis' desire that his pontificate was rooted not in Rome and in clerics but in the lives of believers around the world.\nA complex legacy\nThroughout his papacy, there was a particular focus on reaching out to those on the economic and political margins, his words and actions encouraging his priests to be closer to the disadvantaged.\nThe issue of dignity for migrants was hugely important to him throughout his papacy, but so too was building bridges with other Christian denominations, other religions and those of no faith.\nOn occasions, to some Catholic traditionalists, the Pope's outreach appeared inappropriate for someone of his position, like his visit to a centre for asylum seekers outside Rome in spring 2016 when he washed and kissed the feet of refugees that included Muslims, Hindus and Coptic Christians.\nPope Francis meets migrants on April 16, 2016 in Mytilene on the Greek island of Lesbos\nAs well as becoming a passionate voice for migrants - once going to lay a wreath on the waters where many had died on their perilous journeys - he also linked the impact of climate change to poverty.\nIn speeches, including one to US Congress, and in one of his most important pieces of work, the decree Laudato Si, Pope Francis talked of environmental damage amounting to rich countries inflicting harm on poor ones.\nVehemently anti-war, the Pope frequently talked of conflict itself equating to failure.\nHe called the war in Gaza \"terrorism\" and from early on he implored that there be a ceasefire.\nHe met the families of the Israelis abducted by Hamas on 7 October 2023, but also spoke passionately about the plight of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, particularly children, and made daily calls to the Holy Family Church in Gaza City.\nBut sometimes a longing to build bridges was seen by some observers as getting in the way of Pope Francis taking a firm stance against wrongdoing.\nIn the eyes of many, he failed to unequivocally call out Russian aggression in Ukraine or tackle China's surveillance and persecution of its Catholics.\nFrom the very start of his papacy, he also faced huge tasks confronting misconduct much closer to home.\nThe scourge of corruption had long dogged the upper echelons of the Catholic Church. Early on, Pope Francis closed thousands of unauthorised Vatican bank accounts, and in the latter half of his time he introduced new rules on financial transparency.\nIt was in the way he dealt with the horrors of child sexual abuse by those associated with the Catholic Church that made it clear he knew it was something he would be judged by.\n\"From the very start of my papacy, I felt I was being called to take responsibility for all the evil committed by certain priests,\" he wrote in Hope.\nAs an illustration of the scale of the problem that remains, in 2020 the Catholic Church released lists of living members of clergy in the US alone found to have been accused of sexual abuses - these included clergy linked to child pornography and rape. There were around 2,000.\n\"With shame and repentance, the Church must seek pardon for the terrible damage that those clergy have caused with their sexual abuse of children, a crime that causes deep wounds of pain,\" he recently wrote.\nPope Francis greeting cardinals on Easter Sunday 2025\nAmong other initiatives, Pope Francis introduced rules that meant members of the Church had a responsibility to report on abuse if they had knowledge of it, otherwise they risked being removed from their positions.\nThough he made errors of judgement, on occasions publicly supporting clergy even though they were alleged to have failed to deal with abuse, Pope Francis was quick to apologise for his own mistakes and for the deep failings of the Church.\nBoth at the Vatican and abroad he would frequently meet with Church abuse victims. Saying \"sorry\" for abuse was the prime focus of some foreign trips.\nA huge part of Pope Francis' legacy is the way in which he changed the face of the upper echelons of the Catholic Church through his selection of new cardinals.\nIn fact, about 80% of the cardinals that will select the next pope were appointed by Pope Francis. What is striking about those selections is their diversity, with many coming from South America, Africa and Asia.\nIt was part of Pope Francis' mission to consolidate a change in the centre of gravity of Catholicism away from Europe, where it was in decline, towards the places it was thriving, and to reflect that in Church leadership.\nThe posthumous outpouring of tributes to him from across the globe is perhaps one sign that shift is working.\nMore from InDepth\nWhy is the Pope doing a long tour when he's so frail?\nThe Supreme Court ruling gives clarity - but now comes the difficult part\nThe truth about life on other planets - and what it means for humans\nTop picture credit: Reuters\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "title": "What next after the death of Pope Francis?",
        "contents": "Pope Francis has died at the age of 88, after 12 years as spiritual leader of the Roman Catholic Church.\nHis death has triggered a mourning period which involves centuries-old rites.\nIt has also set into motion the process for electing a new pontiff. A conclave can be expected to be held between 15 and 20 days after Francis's death.\nThis is what we can expect now.\nWhat happens immediately after the Pope dies?\nThe official duties are carried out by the Pope's camerlengo or chamberlain, currently Irish-American Cardinal Kevin Farrell.\nHe is the one who officially confirms the death, with a doctor and death certificate. No autopsy is performed.\nThe Vatican said on Easter Monday, hours after announcing his death, that Francis's body would be laid in a coffin in a chapel in his personal residence at 20:00 local time (18:00 GMT). Farrell would preside over those rites, the Vatican said.\nIt will also fall upon the camerlengo to lock and seal the Pope's home.\nUnlike other popes, Francis did not live in the penthouse apartment in the Apostolic Palace but instead resided in more humble quarters in the form of a two-room suite in the Vatican's Saint Martha guesthouse.\nFarrell also has the responsibility to destroy the Pope's ring and lead seal, which is used to authenticate official documents, so they cannot be used by anyone else.\nHe and a team of three assisting cardinals will then set out the mourning schedule for Pope Francis - including the date of the funeral and burial.\nThe period of mourning rites typically lasts nine days, and church rules say those events should begin between the fourth and sixth day after the Pope's death.\nFarrell and his team will also decide when the Pope's body will be moved into St Peter's Basilica before burial so the public can pay their respects. On Monday afternoon, the Vatican said this transfer could happen as early as Wednesday morning but that cardinals would decide on Tuesday.\nLIVE UPDATES: Pope Francis dies aged 88\nANALYSIS: The Pope from Latin America who changed Catholic Church\nEXPLAINER: What next after the death of Pope Francis?\nWATCH: The pontiff's last public appearance on Easter Sunday\nIN PICTURES: Defining images of the first Latin American pope\nWhat can we expect of the funeral?\nPope Francis shunned much of the Church's pomp and ceremony \u2013 so in keeping with that style he requested his body not be put on a raised platform, the traditional catafalque, in the middle of St Peter's Basilica for public viewing.\nInstead the faithful coming to mourn will simply be able to look upon his body inside his coffin which will have the lid removed.\nHis funeral, according to Church custom, should typically be held within four to six days after his death, with the funeral mass taking place in St Peter's Square.\nPapal funerals have traditionally been elaborate affairs, but Pope Francis acted last year to simplify his arrangements.\nHe will be the first Pope in more than a century not to be buried in the Vatican, in the crypt of St Peter's Basilica  \u2013 opting instead to be laid to rest in Rome's Basilica of St Mary Major, near his favourite icon of the Madonna.\nFrancis also requested to be buried in a simple wooden casket \u2013 unlike his predecessors who were buried in the traditional three nesting coffins made of cypress, lead and oak.\nHow is a new Pope chosen?\nPope Francis's death sets into motion the political process for the Church to select a new leader.\nCardinals from around the world will descend on the Vatican for the election, known as a conclave.\nTraditionally, the 15-day mourning period is observed before the conclave begins. However Francis's predecessor Benedict changed the rules in 2013 to allow it to begin earlier if the cardinals wished. The vote typically takes place 15-20 days after the Pope's death.\nThe new Pope is voted on by the College of Cardinals \u2013 a group of the Church's most senior officials, who are all men, all appointed by the Pope and who are usually all ordained bishops.\nThere are currently 252 Catholic cardinals, but only 135 are eligible to cast ballots as those over the age of 80 can take part in debate but cannot vote.\nMeanwhile, between the Pope's death and the election of his successor, the College of Cardinals governs the Church.\nThey run the day-to-day business of the church but have limited power as much of the Church's central administration stops work and typically, Vatican department heads resign from their positions until they are confirmed or replaced by the new Pope.\nHow does the conclave run?\nThe voting cardinals are locked into a period of pontiff selection where they are cut off from communication with the outside world \u2013 denied phones, the internet and newspapers \u2013 while in discussions and lobbying among themselves to decide the Church's new leader.\nThe conclave, or election, is held in strict secrecy inside the Sistine Chapel, famously painted by Michelangelo.\nA majority of two thirds plus one of the gathering is needed to agree on a new Pope, so multiple rounds of voting are often needed to get a result. After the first day, a secret ballot takes place twice a day and the process can often stretch to several days.\nIn previous centuries, voting has gone on for weeks or months. Some cardinals have even died during conclaves.\nTo the outside world, the only clue as to how it is progressing is the smoke that emerges from the chapel's chimney, the product of the cardinals' ballot papers being burned.\nBlack smoke signals failure. White smoke means a new Pope has been chosen.\nHow is the decision about the new Pope made public?\nAfter the white smoke goes up, the new Pope normally appears within an hour on the balcony overlooking St Peter's Square.\nThe senior cardinal participating in the conclave will announce the decision with  the words \"Habemus Papam\" - Latin for \"we have a Pope\".\nHe will then introduce the new Pope by his chosen papal name, which may or may not be his original given name.\nFor example, Pope Francis was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, but he chose a different name for his papacy in honour of St Francis of Assisi.\nWho can become the Pope?\nIn theory, any Roman Catholic man who has been baptised can be considered for election to become Pope.\nIn practice, however, the cardinals prefer to select one of their own.\nIn 2013, the Argentine-born Francis became the first pontiff to hail from South America - a region that accounts for around 28% of the world's Catholics - and the southern hemisphere.\nHistorical precedent suggests the cardinals are far more likely to pick a European - and especially an Italian. Of the 266 popes chosen to date, 217 have been from Italy.\nSeveral Vatican analysts have suggested it is possible Francis's successor could come from outside Europe - not least because the late Pope appointed more than 140 cardinals from beyond the continent during his tenure.\nWhat does the Pope do?\nThe Pope is the head of the Catholic Church. Roman Catholics believe he represents a direct line back to Jesus Christ. He is considered a living successor to St Peter, who was chief among Christ's initial disciples, the Apostles.\nThat gives him full and unhindered power over the entire Catholic Church and makes him an important source of authority for the world's roughly 1.4 billion Catholics.\nWhile many Catholics often consult the Bible for guidance, they can also turn to the teachings of the Pope, which govern the Church's beliefs and practices.\nAbout half of all Christians worldwide are Roman Catholics. Other denominations, including Protestants and Orthodox Christians, do not recognise the Pope's authority.\nThe Pope lives in Vatican City, the smallest independent state in the world. It is surrounded by the Italian capital, Rome.\nThe Pope does not receive a salary, but all his travel costs and living expenses are paid for by the Vatican.\nRelated topics",

        "contents": "Museum staff believe the binding and corners of this book are made using the skin of 19th Century murderer William Corder\nThe cover of a book held at a Suffolk museum was recently found to be made from the skin of a man hanged for a notorious murder almost 200 years ago.\nWilliam Corder was convicted of killing a woman in 1827, which shocked Georgian Britain and became known as the Red Barn Murder.\nCurators at Moyse's Hall Museum in Bury St Edmunds realised the book, which was on a bookshelf in an office, had been overlooked but it has now gone on display.\nIt had been donated decades ago by a family with close connections to the surgeon who anatomised Corder's body.\nSo what do we know of William Corder and the murder, which fascinates to this day?\nWho were William and his victim Maria?\nWilliam Corder's legacy lives on, as the Red Barn Murder continues to enthrall\nWilliam was from a middle-class family of tenant farmers in the village of Polstead, between Ipswich and Sudbury, at the turn of the 19th Century.\nAt the age of 22, when he and Maria Marten became lovers, he was the head of the Corder family and had a reputation as a ladies' man. Maria, who was 24 and lived at home with her mole-catcher father, a stepmother, sister, and her young son, may have seen young William as a means of escape.\nIn 1827, William came up with a plan to elope, telling Maria to meet him at the Red Barn on the Corder's farm, then run off to Ipswich to get the banns for their wedding.\nMaria was not seen again and William disappeared.\nAt 24, Maria was comparatively old to be living at home\nWhat happened next?\nWilliam eventually left Suffolk and wrote to the Marten family to say he had eloped with Maria to the Isle of Wight.\nIn reality, he was holed up just outside London and Maria was buried at the lovers' rendezvous, having been shot in the neck.\nAlmost a year later, legend states, Ann Marten had a dream her stepdaughter was dead and at the Red Barn. Maria's father dug with his \"mole spud\" spade and found his daughter's remains.\nAs a manhunt ensued, a newspaper editor flagged that he knew of a William Corder.\n\"He is effectively on the run, and the theory is he's lonely, and puts an advert in the newspaper asking for a new wife,\" says Dan Clarke, a heritage officer at Moyse's Hall Museum. It holds many Red Barn Murder artefacts, including two books covered in Corder's skin.\nThe authorities traced Corder, who denies any knowledge of Maria, but has a letter from Polstead telling him her body has been found.\nThe trial and public hanging\nWilliam Corder's hanging attracted a mass of people who sang and danced\nCorder was brought to Bury St Edmunds on 10 counts of murder, each based on a different theory about Maria's demise and to strengthen the chance of a conviction.\nIn his defence he claimed Maria had killed herself, thereby accusing the dead woman of a capital crime. He was found guilty after a two-day trial, and in a final confession said he had accidentally shot Maria during an argument.\nIt is estimated 7,000 to 10,000 people came to see him hanged outside the prison at the stroke of noon on 11 August 1828. Later that day, people queued to file past his body at the town's Shire Hall.\n\"There were so many people, the story goes they couldn't get him outside the prison, so they had to hit a hole in the side of the building and create a temporary scaffold,\" said Mr Clarke.\n\"There would have been singing and dancing, you would have been able  to buy a section of the rope afterwards.\"\nPolstead became a tourist attraction, the Red Barn and even Maria's gravestone chipped away by souvenir-hunters.\nA newspaper from 1828 reporting William Corder's execution\nCorder's legacy\nWilliam Corder's death mask is at Moyse's Hall and Norwich Castle\nPublic intrigue in the Red Barn Murder sparked books, plays and music, and it permeates the true crime culture to this day.\nAt a distance of two centuries, it has become a ripping yarn, the true story clouded in legend.\nIt is probably fuelled, in part, by being able to stand face-to-face with Corder's image, his eyes shut and his nostrils flared. His death mask is held at Moyse Hall and Norwich Castle.\nFor many years, until it eventually began to fall apart, his skeleton was used to teach medical students at West Suffolk Hospital.\nDisturbingly, two books were covered in his skin and part of the man's scalp, with ear included, was kept as a gruesome ornament. All are at Moyse Hall.\nTerry Deary, who created Horrible Histories, believes Corder has been \"maligned\" with Maria incorrectly portrayed as an innocent young maiden.\nMoyse's Hall said it would redress the focus on Corder with a future exhibition which will shine a light on woman victims in Suffolk history, including Maria.\nHeritage assistant Abbie Smith said 80% of its visitors were \"desperate\" to know about the Red Barn Murder.\n\"How it ended is a big factor, it was such a spectacle and people are going to be drawn to it.\n\"It's a gory, grotty one, so people seem to like that - rather worryingly.\"\nGet in touch\nDo you have a story suggestion for Suffolk?\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, external, Instagram, external and X, external.\nRelated topics\nMore on this story\nBook bound in human skin found in museum office\nThe Suffolk books bound in human skin",

It was revealed she did not have the correct qualifications to run the tour.\nIn court on Tuesday Mr Mark Watson KC, prosecuting, explained there was an \"obvious potential for real danger\".\nHe told the court that several members of the group had very limited experience.\nAdding that both Nerys Bethan Lloyd and her business partner Paul O'Dwyer were \"not remotely qualified\", as they only had a \"basic entry level qualification\" which was not suitable for the tour they led.\nHe explained that the pair \"briefly stopped in the town centre to inspect the river\" that day but \"did not inspect the weir itself\", adding they knew there was a weir on that stretch of river having paddleboarded there in August.\nNerys Lloyd, wearing a dark coat and on the right, outside Haverfordwest Magistrates' Court at a previous hearing\nThe group of seven participants and co-instructor Paul O'Dwyer set off after 09:00 on the 30 October 2021.\nThe court heard there had been heavy rain in the days before and \"the river was in flood conditions\" with a \"visibly strong current\".\n\"Of the eight individuals who went over the weir that day only four survived,\" he said.\nMr Watson explained there were desperate attempts of \"bystanders who tried to throw lifelines into the weir\".\nThe court heard that the intensity of the water that day \"was the equivalent of two tons of water crossing the 1m of the weir crest every second\".\nThe weather conditions meant that the difference between water levels above and below the weir on that day would have been \"a drop of 1.3m\".\nMark Powell, the husband of Andrea Powell, gave the first victim impact statement.\nAddressing the court he said the pair had moved to Wales as a better place to raise their son.\nBreaking down in tears he explained the last time he saw Andrea as \"happy and content\" was the day before the incident when they said goodbye as she left for the trip to Haverfordwest.\nHe then saw Andrea in Withybush hospital where she was in coma. He said he \"burst into tears\" seeing the cuts and bruises to her face and body. She had been resuscitated twice.\n\"I sat with her crying and playing her favourite songs,\" he said.\nMr Powell said their son, Finn and Andrea \"had the most amazing bond\".\nWhen he told Finn, who was 7 at the time of her death, that the doctors couldn't save her and she had died, he burst out in \"uncontrollable tears\".\nHe said that the noise of his son that day will stay with him forever.\nHe explained it has impacted him as well suffering \"emotional breakdowns\" and saying it was \"heart-breaking\" to hear his child say \"he wants to die so he can be with his mother again\".\nMr Powell said that Andrea was an \"extraordinary human being\" having saved the lives of five people after her death as an organ donor.\nHe said the fact she did not die peacefully still causes troubles and causes him distress.\n\"How can a serving police officer allow this to happen?\"\nHe said Nerys was \"not fit to hold my wife's life in her hands\", adding he \"cannot forgive her lack of remorse\".\nMr Powell said: \"Whatever the outcome, Nerys will continue to live and breathe and 'feel the sun on her face'.\"\nAddressing her directly in the dock, he said even if Nerys ends up in a prison with people who do not look favourably on ex-police officers \"it will be nothing in comparison to what she has put them through and continue to put them through\".\nJohn Taylor, father of Andrea Powell was the second family member to address the court. He said, \"Andrea was the life and soul of every party\".\nHe said that after a week in hospital \"all hope was gone\".\n\"We miss Andrea every day\" and \"pray that in death I will meet her again\".\nHe said that her loss has put a strain on them and the pain will never go away.\n\"Our past, our present and our future will never ever be the same again,\" he said.\nTheresa Hall, mother of Morgan Rogers, told the court that Morgan's loss follows her like a shadow.\nShe said that Ms Lloyd \"guided Morgan to her death\" and the \"physical and mental pain that I now live with is too much to bear\".\nSpeaking to Nerys, she said, \"in your arrogance have stopped me being able to fully grieve for my daughter\".\n\"We were always a tight unit\" and that \"Morgan was the one who would galvanise us\" for day trips.\n\"Every day of my life is absolutely horrendous\" knowing she died a \"horrific death.\"\nBreaking down in tears, she told Nerys that she would never forgive her \"for what you have taken away from me\".\nRobert Rogers, father of Morgan Rogers, said that she was \"warm, courageous, happy shiny star to all she knew was extinguished.\"\n\"As a father to have to bury your own daughter is not a path you want any other human being to walk,\" he said.\n\"The open wound inflicted will never ever heal.\n\"My family will have a life sentence of grief for our remaining days,\" he said.\nDarren Wheatley, husband of Nicola Wheatley, called Ms Lloyd \"a coward\" and \"a disgraced business owner\".\n\"You have hidden behind your carefully orchestrated smoke screen,\" he said.\nHe said the next time he would see his wife would be to identify her body.\n\"Battered, swollen, bleeding from the head. Nicola was stone cold,\" he said.\n\"I couldn't imagine what she had gone through.\n\"This was not the Nicola that left our house less than 24 hours earlier but it is the face I see every day when I open my eyes,\" he said.\nWith audible anger in his voice he said while they \"cried all day\" that Christmas in 2021 without their mother, Ms LLoyd was posting pictures on social media celebrating Christmas lights with her family and friends.\nMs Lloyd was straight faced in the dock as Mr Wheatley looked at her saying  \"think of the lives you have ripped apart and changed forever\".\nEnding his speech he said, \"Nerys Lloyd you are a vile person and you disgust me\".\nA statement from Kerry O'Dwyer, wife of Paul O'Dwyer was read on her behalf. She said she is \"tortured\" by what happened that day.\nKnowing \"I only survived because Andrea kicked me to safety in the weir,\" she said.\nShe said that Paul was the kindest man \"with the biggest heart\".\nAddressing Ms Lloyd, she said that she was once her friend but was met with \"blame, rejection and gaslighting\" by Ms Lloyd when she tried to \"shift blame\" onto Paul.\nShe called Ms Lloyd as fraud and said Ms Lloyd carried \"on freely, going on holidays, attending parties.\"\nPaul made a \"devastating mistake\" but he \"died trying to save others\" saying that was the type of man he was.\n\"Grief is in our household every single day. You carried on as if nothing ever happened,\" she said.\n\"Nerys, I do not believe you will ever learn from this, you've had three years to show remorse and yet you have continued like this is an inconvenience to your life.\"\nJohn O'Dwyer, the father of Paul O'Dwyer, said the \"grief is relentless\".\n\"You wake up in the early hours and you cry. You carry on with your day but everything is hollow,\" he said.\n\"He was a true friend.\n\"Paul you gave everything without expecting anything in return we miss you every single day,\" he said.\nRelated topics\nMore on this story\nEx-paddleboard firm owner in court after deaths\nFour paddleboarder deaths were avoidable - report\nPaddleboard firm owner admits manslaughter of four",

        "contents": "The boy, who died of his injuries after being stabbed, had a Japanese father and Chinese mother\nChina has executed a man for fatally stabbing a 10-year-old Japanese boy last September, the Japanese embassy in China has told the BBC.\nZhong Changchun was sentenced to death in January for attacking the boy, who had been walking to a Japanese school in south-eastern Chinese city of Shenzhen.\nThe case had sent shockwaves through both countries and fuelled diplomatic tensions amid allegations of it being a xenophobic attack.\n\"The Government of Japan considers the murder of a completely innocent child to be an unforgivable crime, and we take this execution with the utmost solemnity,\" the Japanese embassy said in its statement to the BBC.\n\"In light of this incident, the Japanese government will continue to take all possible safety measures and strongly urge the Chinese side to ensure the safety of Japanese nationals in China.\"\nIt said that it had been informed of the execution by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nThe incident heightened fears among Japanese living in China and prompted Japanese companies including Toyota to ask their staff to take precautions.  Others, like Panasonic, offered employees free flights home.\nThe verdict on Zhong's case made no mention of Japan, Japanese officials previously said. Kenji Kanasugi, Japan's ambassador to China said Zhong had requested to speak to the victim's family, but did not say if he had been targeting Japanese nationals.\nThe incident has also shone a light on the unchecked nationalism on Chinese social media, which has fuelled anti-foreigner sentiment in recent years.\nOnline commentators noted that the schoolboy's killing had happened on a politically sensitive date - 18 September, the anniversary of an incident that led to the Japanese occupation of Manchuria in China in the early 1930s.\nHistorical grievances have long overshadowed political tensions between China and Japan. China has long demanded an apology from Japan for its colonial and wartime aggression in the early and mid 20 Century. It has also accused Japan of glossing over its brutal military actions in China in its history textbooks.\nThe stabbing also came amid a spate of high-profile attacks on foreigners in China, including the stabbing of four American teachers in Jilin.\nLast June, a man attacked a Japanese mother and her child at a bus stop in Suzhou but ended up killing a Chinese woman trying to protect them. The man has also been executed, Japanese officials said last week.\nRelated topics\nMore on this story\nA Japanese boy was killed in China.
