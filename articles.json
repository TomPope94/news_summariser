        "contents": "In response to why Beijing is not backing down to Donald Trump on tariffs, the answer is that it doesn't have to.\nChina's leaders would say that they are not inclined to cave in to a bully \u2013 something its government has repeatedly labelled the Trump administration as \u2013 but it also has a capacity to do this way beyond any other country on Earth.\nBefore the tariff war kicked in, China did have a massive volume of sales to the US but, to put it into context, this only amounted to 2% of its GDP.\nThat said, the Communist Party would clearly prefer not to be locked in a trade war with the US at a time when it has been struggling to fix its own considerable economic headaches, after years of a real estate crisis, overblown regional debt and persistent youth unemployment.\nHowever, despite this, the government has told its people that it is in a strong position to resist the attacks from the US.\nIt also knows its own tariffs are clearly going to hurt US exporters as well.\nTrump has been bragging to his supporters that it would be easy to force China into submission by simply hitting the country with tariffs, but this has proven to be misleading in the extreme.\nBeijing is not going to surrender.\nThis video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nHow is the trade war with the US affecting people in China?\nChina's leader Xi Jinping told the visiting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Friday that his country and the European Union should \"jointly resist the unilateral bullying practices\" of the Trump administration.\nSanchez, in turn, said that China's trade tensions with the US should not impede its cooperation with Europe.\nTheir meeting took place in the Chinese capital in the hours before Beijing again increased its tariffs on goods from the US - though it has said it will not respond to further US tariff increases.\nNext week Xi will visit Malaysia, Vietnam and Cambodia. These are all countries which have been hit hard by Trump's tariffs.\nHis ministers have been meeting counterparts from South Africa, Saudi Arabia and India, talking up greater trade co-operation.\nIn addition, China and the EU are reportedly in talks about potentially removing European tariffs on Chinese cars, to be replaced by a minimum price instead, to rein in a new round of dumping.\nIn short, wherever you look, you can see that China has options.\nAnd analysts have said that these mutual tariff increases by the two superpowers are now becoming almost meaningless, as they've already passed the point of cutting out much of the trade between them.\nSo, the tit-for-tat tariff increases in both directions have become more like symbolism.\nChina's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning has, over the past two days, posted images of Chairman Mao on social media, including a clip during the Korean War when he told the US that \"no matter how long this war lasts we will never yield\".\nAbove this, she posted her own comments, saying: \"We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We won't back down.\"\nWhen the Chinese government wheels out Chairman Mao, you know they're getting serious.\nRelated topics\nMore on this story\nTrump had five tariff goals - has he achieved any of them?\nWatch: Was Trump's 90-day tariffs pause really a grand plan?\nWill iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?",

        "title": "Police raid barbers and vape shops suspected of being fronts for crime gangs",
        "contents": "This video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nPolice raided 265 businesses, including barbers, mini-marts and vape shops\nPolice officers smash through the back doors of a bright, modern barber shop in the market town of Shrewsbury.\nInside they immediately detain two men - who we are later told are Kurdish asylum seekers. Both men are later released.\nIt is the first of six raids that day where police seize thousands of pounds in cash and illicit vapes.\nThe officers are here with a warrant to search the premises because of suspected money laundering. They say their intelligence also suggests the shop is linked to sale of illicit cigarettes and vapes, illegal immigration and drug-dealing.\nDet Insp Daniel Fenn, on his ninth raid of the week, says some barber shops such as this are claiming income of \u00a3100,000 to \u00a3150,000 a month. \"They aren't getting that amount of customers to warrant that amount of money.\"\nCCTV in other barbers that have been raided has shown they do not have many customers, so footage of this one will also be examined, DI Fenn says.\nThe raid in Shrewsbury was one of 265 carried out across England and Wales last month as part of a crackdown on High Street businesses - often Turkish-style barbers, vape shops and mini-marts - suspected of being fronts for international crime gangs.\nPoliticians and members of the public have raised concerns about many of these businesses which have boomed even while High Streets appear to be in decline. The average number of barbers per person in England and Wales has doubled in the past 10 years, according to commercial property analysts Green Street.\nNow the National Crime Agency (NCA) says it has launched the crackdown, called Operation Machinize, in response to growing intelligence reports that some of these shops are being used for money laundering - where gangs falsely present the proceeds of criminal operations as if they were earnings from legitimate businesses handling large amounts of cash.\nDet Insp Daniel Fenn, searching a barber shop, says criminals feel they can hide in quiet neighbourhoods\nDespite these shops operating openly for years on High Streets and attracting widespread local suspicion, this is the first co-ordinated action of its kind by police, tax and immigration inspectors and Trading Standards officers. We were given exclusive access to dozens of raids carried out by Greater Manchester and West Mercia Police.\nDet Insp Melanie Johnson, who led the operation for Greater Manchester Police, said her own local High Street had 10 barbers and a mini-mart, which was \"not sustainable\".\n\"As a mum to young children, I want them to grow up feeling safe, in a community that isn't derelict, a High Street that isn't falling apart, and isn't populated by criminality,\" she said.\nDuring the operation:\nPolice targeted a series of linked mini-marts in Rochdale that they suspect are \"fronts\" for illegal activity, staffed by Kurdish, Iraqi and Iranian asylum seekers. Officers later said some of the staff were working in the UK illegally\nA cannabis farm was found in Leigh and over 150 plants seized. Also found during raids across Greater Manchester were brown powder believed to be heroin, vials of testosterone, nitrous oxide, Xanax tranquilliser and a machete\n35 people were arrested, and 55 suspected illegal immigrants were questioned. Three potential victims of modern slavery were identified\nBank accounts and assets worth over \u00a31m were later frozen and \u00a340,000 in cash was seized\nThe Shrewsbury raid was on a barber shop in the centre of town, one of five close together which were also targeted in the operation.\n\"Members of the public are angry. They can see these fronts are there,\" says Det Insp Fenn. \"The criminals feel they are hidden here. They think they can come to sleepy areas such as Shrewsbury and Telford and won't be found.\"\nIt looks like the two men detained here have been living in the rooms above the barbers - there are clothes, shoes and food scattered on the floor as we move from room to room. The flats are barely furnished, with just a mattress and blankets on the floor.\nDet Insp Fenn says organised crime groups are different all over the country, but here he has been seeing familiar patterns of shops staffed with asylum seekers or illegal immigrants, many of the people in the barber shops being from Kurdish backgrounds.\nSome of the shops had hidden compartments\nThe detective says that behind the front of a High Street business \"the main criminality may be modern-day slavery, exploitation and drugs\".\nDespite the barber shop's supposed high revenue, police find an unpaid \u00a37,000 gas bill along with the seized cash and illicit vapes.\nLegitimate barbers say they want to see a registration scheme and a crackdown on unscrupulous operators. Gareth Penn, chief executive of the Hair and Barber Council, said the rise of illegal barbers has led to fungal infections, such as ringworm, from improperly cleaned equipment.\n\"This has a massive impact on legitimate businesses as they can't compete against those with few of the costs genuine barbers have,\" said Mr Penn.\nThe NCA estimates that \u00a312bn in illicit cash is laundered in the UK every year, some of it through criminal front organisations on the High Street. Their numbers appeared to surge as shop vacancies grew in the wake of the pandemic, creating an opening for criminal gangs.\nPoliticians began to demand action, prompting law enforcement, tax, immigration and Trading Standards agencies to develop this co-ordinated response.\nThe NCA now has to analyse what Operation Machinize has uncovered for evidence of fraud and money laundering, to try to trace the networks behind these shops and stop the flow of criminal cash.\nRachael Herbert, deputy director of economic crime at the NCA, said the presence of criminal front organisations \"gives the perception from the local community that criminals have the run of the High Street\" and contributes to the demise of shopping centres.\n\"Money laundering is not a victimless crime. It's associated with some of the most high-harm and violent crimes on the street,\" she said.\nPolice seized cash in the raids along with drugs, illicit tobacco and vapes\nThe NCA believes some barber shops or mini-marts are used as fronts for drug-trafficking, people-smuggling, modern slavery and child sexual exploitation. These kinds of shops have also been linked to the illicit importation of tobacco, vapes and firearms.\nIn 2023, it secured the conviction of one Iranian Kurdish barber shop owner, Hewa Rahimpur, who was using his shop in London as a base for a far-reaching criminal organisation which smuggled 10,000 people to the UK in small boats.\n\"These businesses also evade an enormous amount of tax. That is money that doesn't go to the exchequer to be used for local communities,\" Ms Herbert said.\nSeeing illicit products like vapes, cigarettes and tobacco on sale is also a red flag to the investigating teams.\nIn Rochdale, the sniffer dog shakes with excitement, her tail wagging frantically, above a hole concealing dozens of boxes of illegally imported tobacco products in one shop.\n\"We could hit this shop every day for a week and we'd still find stuff. It's non-stop,\" Dennis Chalmers from Trading Standards says. \"These shops are just set up to do this.\"\nOutside on the street, Mr Chalmers gestures to half a dozen shops on the street which he has visited and believes to be linked. \"They seem to be popping up everywhere. There's like five, six hairdressers in one row.\"\nTrading Standards officer Dennis Chalmers says he wants more powers to shut down shops\nHe estimates across Rochdale there are more than 20 businesses that are fronts for criminal organisations and he says he sees many of the same people from Iran, Iraq and Kurdistan working in them.\nIn one shop, a worker who says he is Kurdish claims he has only worked there for two days.\n\"Two days?\" asks Mr Chalmers. \"Even though I saw you here last week?\"\nThe shop worker tells the Trading Standards officer he doers not know his boss's name.\nMr Chalmers tells us: \"The danger is, because you don't know who is behind these businesses, as the employee doesn't know who the owner is, when we try and chase them they just keep changing, changing.\"\nCompanies House documents show the shop address has been used to register four almost-identically named businesses since 2019, three of which faced action to strike them off the company register for failing to file accounts properly.\nImmigration officers say the Kurdish man in the shop has been in the country for four years, but has been granted the right to work while he waits for his asylum application to be decided.\nClose by, police and Trading Standards officers show us more mini-marts that have been left empty - they say staff disappeared as soon as police arrived.\nOutside one, a man approaches us laughing. It is clear he is not put off by the police action. He tells us he is from Iran and, when questioned, claims he does not work in the shop. We return later and see him inside the mini-mart, apparently working.\n\"We see him every day,\" says Mr Chalmers in frustration. \"It's just a game to them. A dangerous one.\"\nHe says he would like more resources to get on top of the issue and greater powers to shut down these premises more quickly.\nTwo people were detained in Shrewsbury, while 35 were arrested in the operation as a whole\nSecurity Minister Dan Jarvis said the operation \"highlights the scale and complexity of the criminality our towns and cities face\".\n\"High Street crime undermines our security, our borders, and the confidence of our communities, and I am determined to take the decisive action necessary to bring those responsible to justice,\" he said.\nBut so far only 10 of the shops that were raided last month across England have been shut down. The majority of the shops we visited were back up and running within minutes of the police leaving.\nIn Rochdale, we watched as Trading Standards officers identified a man they said was linked to the mini-marts walking from shop to shop with a backpack, which they believed contained illicit tobacco to restock the shelves.\nThe challenge for authorities now is to stop the problem at its root and dismantle the suspected serious organised crime gangs - which may have been profiting in plain sight for years on our High Streets.\nAdditional reporting by Rebecca Wearn\nGet in touch\nDo you have information related to this story you'd like to pass on to our journalists?\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

I accept that you are remorseful and that you do think about this on a daily basis and you'll feel remorse about this for the rest of your life.\"\nPrevious convictions\nThe court was told Kelly had previous convictions for assault and careless driving.\nIn the dock on Tuesday, he apologised to the Wilson family.\n\"It's horrible to me so I can't imagine what it's been like for you,\" he said.\n\"I was careless with my speed that night. It won't bring back your wee boy but hope pleading guilty brings some closure\".\nDean and Emma Wilson are devastated by the death of their 'baby' Ronan\nFor Ronan's grieving family the sentence is little comfort.\n\"We are just lost without him\" said Ronan's father Dean Wilson.\n\"It was his birthday there on Friday past. We just went to the grave and all his wee classmates came to the grave as well,\" he said.\n\"That's all we could do for him, sing happy birthday. He should have been 11. He only got to nine and a half\".\nRonan Wilson with his father Dean and brother Calum\nSpeaking ahead of the sentencing, Ronan's mother Emma said she felt like she was \"falling apart\".\n\"It doesn't really matter what he gets because it's never going to bring Ronan back,\" she said.\n\"He was a wee rascal, but he had a heart of gold, and he was just loved by everybody, and had so many friends.\n\"Nobody wants to do anything anymore because Ronan's not here. He was the baby.\"\nRonan's mum Emma said she was \"lost\" since Ronan's death\nIn March, Donegal County Council put speed bumps along the road where Ronan was killed.\nIt is move that has come too late for the Wilson family.\n\"I feel angry that they weren't up before now. And it's taken Ronan's death to get them,\" his mother said.\nHis father said they \"should have been up years ago\".\n\"It's a very, very busy place with amusements, Water World, go-kart track, all the apartments and things on both sides of the road there,\" he said.\n\"It's madness that they didn't have speed bump ramps up there years and years ago.\"\nRelated topics\nMore on this story\nMan bailed after boy's death in Donegal crash\nRonan Wilson, aged nine, dies in Donegal hit-and-run crash",

He has been sentenced to death.\nThe BBC has seen an Egyptian court document, from July, showing that Lobna has custody of Zayn. As far as Lobna is aware, this is still the legal position.\nLobna's MP, Sinn F\u00e9in's John Finucane, who has been helping her, said it was a \"distressing\" situation.\n'I took my son and left'\nThis video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n\nShe has not seen Zayn since 2021, but said she had made numerous attempts to reunite with him.\nHer son was born in Michigan, in the US, but the family moved to Egypt when he was two. She also brought Zayn on a visit to Belfast when he was one.\nLobna said she was in an abusive marriage with Selim for more than seven years and that she feared for her life before leaving him in 2020.\n\"It got to a point where I just couldn't stay,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\"I took my son and left. He didn't contact us for six months, then he wanted us back.\"\nHowever, in 2021, at a short meeting with his father in Egypt, she said Zayn was taken away from her and she has not seen him since.\n\"I have been fighting to see him,\" she said.\nLobna told the BBC that her ex tried to kill her and sent threatening messages.\n'I knew deep down he was going to kill me'\nLobna Yakout with her son Zayn\nIt was then that she fled back to Belfast.\n\"No-one believed that he would try to kill me.

        "contents": "This video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nBritish man\u2019s tattoo wrongly linked to Venezuelan gang in US government document\nA tattoo belonging to a man from Derbyshire has appeared in a US government document used to identify members of a notorious Venezuelan gang - despite the man having no connection to the group.\nPete Belton, 44, from Ilkeston says he was shocked to find his forearm featured in a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) document used to help identify alleged members of Tren de Aragua (TdA), a transnational criminal organisation.\n\"I'm just an average middle-aged man from Derbyshire,\" he told BBC Verify.\nMr Belton said it was a \"bit strange, bit funny at first\" but is now worried the family trip he booked to Miami with his wife and daughter in August might end up \"being a six month all-inclusive holiday to Guantanamo\".\nThe Trump administration has already deported hundreds of alleged gang members to a high-security jail in El Salvador. Lawyers for some of those deportees say they have been incorrectly identified as TdA members based on their tattoos.\nMr Belton's tattoo - a clock face with the date and time of his daughter's birth - was included in a set of nine images for \"detecting and identifying\" TdA members. Other tattoos featured stars, crowns and a Michael Jordan \"jumpman\" logo.\n\"Open source material has depicted TdA members with a combination of the below tattoos,\" states the document which appeared in court filings, external.\nBut reverse image searches show that several of the pictures first appeared on tattoo websites with no obvious links to Venezuela or TdA.\nOne of them led BBC Verify to an Instagram post by a Nottingham-based tattoo artist who posted about Mr Belton's tattoo nearly a decade ago.\nThe tattoo image in the DHS document is worse quality than the Instagram post, which was shared in 2016, but it is clearly the same arm and features the same clock face tattoo.\nThe same image of Mr Belton's tattoo also appeared in a September 2024 report by the Texas Department of Public Safety, external (DPS) about TdA activity.\nBBC Verify contacted both the US DHS and the Texas DPS about the source of the images, but did not receive a response.\nBut in an email the DHS said it was confident in its law enforcement's intelligence and that its \"assessments go well beyond just gang affiliate tattoos and social media.\"\nIt's unclear exactly how Mr Belton's tattoo ended up in the US documents, but he's worried about being linked to the gang.\n\"In my head I'm thinking if I'm working in border force and I saw me walking through I'd think 'hey up we've got one, he's the one in the document'.\"\nHe provided multiple images of the tattoo to prove that it's his - and he says that he has no association to the Venezuelan group.\nThis image shows Mr Belton's tattoo before it was finished in 2016\nThe US government hasn't deported anyone based on their tattoos alone, according to comments from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official in a court filing last month, external.\nHowever, court documents show immigration officials are employing a points-based system known as the \"Alien Enemy Validation Guide\", external to determine if someone is linked to the Venezuelan gang.\nIt includes a scorecard, and according to the document, eight points across a number of categories could be grounds for arrest or deportation.\nHalf of these points can be given if a \"subject has tattoos denoting membership or loyalty to TdA\".\nThe document says if all eight points come from the symbolism category, which includes tattoos, then further consultation should be taken before designating someone as a member of TdA.\nVenezuelan investigative journalist Ronna Risquez, who wrote a book on TdA's origins, said tattoos alone are not evidence of membership.\n\"TdA does not have tattoos that identifies the gang,\" she said.\n\"To confirm whether a person is a member of TdA, authorities must conduct a police investigation to determine whether they have a criminal record. A tattoo, their clothing, or their nationality are not proof.\"\nHowever, there have been cases where lawyers have argued that people have been wrongfully identified based on their tattoos and were subsequently deported.\nUS media, external have reported on a man whose lawyers say was deported because of a crown tattoo which was inspired by the Real Madrid football club logo.\nAnother case saw a makeup artist, external sent to El Salvador after his a crown tattoo with the words \"mum\" and \"dad\" was used by US officials as evidence for gang membership, according to his attorneys.\nBack in Derbyshire, Mr Belton says his family have considered cancelling their trip to the US due to the potential risks, but they are going to monitor how the story develops.\n\"Hopefully now they'd realise I'm not a Venezuelan gangster but I've seen crazier things happen in the news recently, so we're just going to wait and see.\"\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?\nRelated topics",

        "contents": "The UK economy grew by more than predicted in February and exports to the US increased by \u00a3500m as businesses rushed to beat US tariffs.\nThe economy expanded by 0.5%, with the services sector having a strong month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.\nThe better-than-expected figures come as the UK economy braces itself for the impact of tariffs imposed on goods imported to the US, with analysts warning that growth could prove short-lived.\nTariffs on steel and aluminium came into effect on 12 March, while a 10% tariff on other goods came into effect this week.\nGoods exports from the UK to the US increased for the third consecutive month and are now at the highest level since November 2022, the ONS said.\n\"There are clear signs that UK firms increased goods exports to the US ahead of the introduction of tariffs,\" said William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC).\n\"Data for the past three months shows a 23% increase in the value of goods flowing from the UK across the Atlantic,\" Mr Bain said.\nEconomists had predicted UK growth of just 0.1% in February, but the ONS said several factors contributed to the surprise rise which was driven by a boost in manufacturing and production.\nThe government has made growing the UK economy its top priority in its effort to improve living standards.\nLiz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said February's surprise growth was due to computer programming, telecoms and car dealerships in the services sector all having \"strong months\".\nShe added that manufacturing, electronics and pharmaceutical businesses performed well, and the car making industry also picked up after \"its recent poor performance\".\nChancellor Rachel Reeves called the latest growth figures an \"encouraging sign\", but added the government was \"not complacent\".\n\"We must go further and faster to kickstart economic growth, provide security for working people and put more money in their pockets,\" she added.\nThe UK is subject to the blanket 10% tariff on nearly all of its goods being brought into the US, which is expected to hit British exporters and also affect economic growth.\nMr Bain from the BCC said securing a deal with the US and removing trade barriers with the EU would be \"key to cushioning the negative impacts of the sweeping new US tariffs\".\nSpeaking to reporters, Reeves said: \"We continue to engage with our counterparts in the United States and of course we want to secure the best deal possible for British jobs and British industry and we are absolutely committed and resolved to do everything we can,\" she told reporters.\nHow fast is the UK's economy growing?\nWhat are tariffs and why is Trump using them?\nAlongside the better-than-expected growth, the ONS revised up its figure for January from a contraction of 0.1% to no growth.\nMonthly figures alone can be volatile so should be taken in context. The more stable three-month average to February shows growth is up 0.6%.\nThis would have been considered normal growth a decade ago, but has been elusive in recent years.\nHowever, it suggests that recent talk of a recession has been way off the mark.\nBut February's figure comes ahead of the impact of tax rises on businesses and household energy and water bill increases on the economy, along with US tariffs.\nRuth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist, said the UK's \"surprisingly strong growth will prove short lived, as rises in tariffs and taxes bite\".\n\"The big picture is that the economy has grown in only four of the last nine months and it's hard to see the economy strengthening much from here,\" she said.\nShadow chancellor Mel Stride said: \"Since coming to office, Labour's choices have killed growth stone dead and there is still a long way to go to recover.\"\nWhile there is an acknowledgement that the uncertainty from US tariffs poses threats to the economy, some experts believe it may also create opportunities for a the UK as a stable, growing trade-friendly economy.\nMitchell Barnes is now planning on taking on fewer staff than he had hoped to\nMitchell Barnes runs a 3D printing company in Warwickshire, designing and manufacturing parts for the automotive industry.\nHalf of the parts made here are exported to the US.\nBut rather than Trump tariffs, he says it is domestic factors that are hitting his business.\nMr Barnes says this month's changes to National Insurance contributions and the minimum wage mean he may need to rethink his plan to create new jobs at the site.\nHe had hoped to increase his number of staff from 27 to 100 over the next 18 months, but has now lowered that to between 30 to 40.\nThe business is now looking to accelerate plans to expand in the United States instead. \"Ultimately, for us, it's all about innovating in order to control our own destiny.\"\nAdditional reporting by Adam Woods\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.\nRelated topics",

It works in a new way, blocking the activity of a protein molecule called AKT which drives cancer growth.\nScientists started working on the drug's development 20 years ago and say it's the most effective cancer drug they've seen for advanced cancer. AstraZeneca is the manufacturer of capivasertib.\nGenetic testing\nThe drug is suitable for those with certain gene mutations that affect up to half of people with hormone receptor positive secondary breast cancer - the most common type, which grows in the presence of oestrogen.\nProf Peter Johnson, clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said it offered \"an additional option\" for some whose cancer has progressed despite previous hormone therapy - but it wouldn't be suitable for everyone.\nClaire Rowney, chief executive at charity Breast Cancer Now, said she was \"delighted\" that the drug would offer some people \"the hope of more precious time to do what matters most to them\".\nBut she said patients had \"faced unnecessary delays in accessing it\" after the drug was initially rejected by NICE, and breast cancer drugs should be approved more quickly for those who need them.\n\"NHS England must now put in place prompt genetic testing to ensure those eligible receive capivasertib without further delay,\" she said, adding that Scotland should also consider funding the treatment quickly so that patients across the UK would have access.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Prof Johnson said NICE had to work through the evidence when approving new drugs for the NHS, and those discussions included how much the drug will cost.\n\"We have to make sure the treatments we bring in are good value for money for the NHS and come in under the cost threshold that we expect, because obviously, particularly in these hard times, money is not plentiful and we need to make sure that the price of the drug and the way it's being used really do constitute... good value for money for the NHS,\" said Prof Johnson.\nNICE says it has approved 24 out of 25 breast cancer treatments it has assessed over the past seven years.\nBreast cancer drug may give patients more time\nDaily pill to prevent breast cancer approved\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

All were onboard the helicopter at the time of the crash, which is under investigation.\n\"Our hearts go out to the families,\" Adams said.\nAuthorities have yet to release the identities, but they have been widely named as Agust\u00edn Escobar and his wife Merc\u00e8 Camprub\u00ed Montal, who were both executives at Siemens, and their children, aged four, five and 11.\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Siemens said: \"We are deeply saddened by the tragic helicopter crash that claimed the lives of Agustin Escobar and his family.\n\"Our deepest condolences go out to all of his relatives.\"\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said the news was devastating and that he shared the grief of the victims' families.\nThe Spanish family lived in Barcelona, and regional leader Salvador Illa sent \"all my affection\" to their family and friends.\nA photograph of the family briefly published by the tour company shows them posing in front of the helicopter before the fatal incident.\nVideo footage shows the helicopter falling out of the sky upside down before splashing into the Hudson River.\nOfficials said the helicopter lost control soon after turning at the George Washington Bridge to move along the New Jersey shoreline.\nThe helicopter was operated by tour company New York Helicopters and took off from the Downtown Skyport on the lower side of Manhattan at 14:59 local time (19:59 BST).\nWhat we know about the Hudson helicopter crash\nThe first calls about the crash came around 15:17 EDT (20:17 BST) and rescue boats were launched immediately, New York Fire Commissioner Robert Tucker said.\n\"Swimmers were in the water shortly after the call,\" he said.\nThis video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nWatch: 'The helicopter just fell' - Hudson River crash leaves six dead\nOnce on the scene, rescuers searched the water for victims or survivors and initiated \"immediate life-saving measures\", but the efforts were unsuccessful.\nFour victims were pronounced dead at the scene, while two others were declared dead at a nearby hospital, officials said.\nThe part of the river where the helicopter crashed is near Manhattan's west side, an area known for its trendy shops and dining. It's also near the main campus of New York University.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the investigation into the crash of the Bell 206 - a two-bladed helicopter - will be led by the National Transportation Safety Board.\nThe Bell 206 is commonly used by sightseeing companies, television news stations and police departments.\nUS President Donald Trump said the crash was terrible and more details would soon be released about what happened.\n\"God bless the families and friends of the victims,\" he wrote on his Truth Social platform.\nRescue boats were launched shortly after the first calls about the crash, which occurred roughly 18 minutes after the helicopter took off\nMichael Roth, the CEO of New York Helicopter Charter Inc, told CNN he was \"devastated\".\n\"I'm a father, a grandfather, and my wife hasn't stopped crying since this afternoon,\" he said. When asked about the maintenance of the helicopter, Mr Roth replied: \"It's my director of maintenance who deals with that.\"\nEyewitnesses who saw the crash told CBS News, the BBC's US news partner, that they saw parts of the helicopter fall from the sky.\n\"I looked outside my window. I saw a few people running towards the water, and some people were acting pretty normal. So I was like oh, it might not be anything. Then I started to hear all the sirens come outside,\" Jersey City resident Jenn Lynk said.\nAnother, Ipsitaa Banigrhi, told CBS the crash sounded like thunder.\n\"I saw, like, black particles flying,\" she said. \"Again, I thought maybe it's just like, dust, or birds, and then we heard all the emergency vehicles and sirens go by, and I think that's when it was like, OK, what's happening.\"\nThis is not the first deadly tourist helicopter crash in New York City. In 2018, another tourist helicopter crashed into the East River. All five passengers drowned with only the pilot surviving.\nIn 2009, a helicopter carrying Italian tourists collided with a private plane over the Hudson River, killing nine.\nRelated topics",

        "contents": "Col Susannah Meyers (left) was fired after reportedly distancing herself from JD Vance's remarks\nThe head of the US military base in Greenland has been fired after she reportedly sent an email distancing herself from Vice-President JD Vance's criticism of Denmark.\nThe US military's Space Operations Command said Col Susannah Meyers had been removed from her role at Pituffik Space Base due to a \"loss of confidence in her ability to lead\".\nLast month, Vance said Denmark had \"not done a good job\" for Greenlanders and had not spent enough on security while visiting the Danish territory.\nThe alleged email, released by a military news site, told staff Vance's comments were \"not reflective\" of the base. A Pentagon spokesman cited the article, saying \"undermining\" US leadership was not tolerated.\nFollowing Vance's trip, on 31 March, Col Meyers is reported to have written: \"I do not presume to understand current politics, but what I do know is the concerns of the US administration discussed by Vice-President Vance on Friday are not reflective of Pituffik Space Base.\"\nMilitary.com - which published the email, external - said the contents had been confirmed as accurate to them by the US Space Force.\nAppearing to confirm this was the reason for her firing, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell linked to the Military.com article in a post on X, writing: \"Actions [that] undermine the chain of command or to subvert President [Donald] Trump's agenda will not be tolerated at the Department of Defense.\"\nThe Space Force's statement announcing Col Meyers' removal on Thursday said that Col Shawn Lee was replacing her.\nIt added: \"Commanders are expected to adhere to the highest standards of conduct, especially as it relates to remaining nonpartisan in the performance of their duties.\"\nCol Meyers had assumed command of the Arctic station in July last year. Col Lee was previously a squadron commander at the Clear Space Force Station in Alaska.\nDuring his whirlwind trip, Vance had also reiterated Trump's desire to annex Greenland for security reasons.\nSince the US delegation's visit, both Greenland and Denmark have shown a united front, opposing a US annexation of the autonomous Danish territory.\nEarlier this month, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's official visit saw her stand side-by-side with her Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen and his predecessor, Mute Egede.\nSpeaking to reporters, Frederiksen directly addressed Trump, telling him: \"You can't annex other countries.\"\nShe added that Denmark was fortifying its military presence in the Arctic, and offered closer collaboration with the US in defending the region.\nThe US has long maintained a security interest in Greenland as a strategically important territory. It has had a military presence on the island since occupying it following the occupation of Denmark by Nazi Germany during World War Two.\n\"If Russia were to send missiles towards the US, the shortest route for nuclear weapons would be via the North Pole and Greenland,\" Marc Jacobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, previously told the BBC.\n\"That's why the Pituffik Space Base is immensely important in defending the US.\"\nGreenland, the world's largest island, has been under Danish control for around 300 years.\nPolls show that the vast majority of Greenlanders want to gain independence from Denmark - but do not wish to become part of the US.\nGreenland has had the right to call an independence referendum since 2009, though in recent years some political parties have begun pushing harder for one to take place.\nRelated topics\nMore on this story\nJD Vance's ominous pitch to Greenland\nDenmark and Greenland show united front against US 'annexation' threats\nWhy does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?",

It's baffled the police, it's baffled the barristers, it's baffled the court, it's probably baffled the hospital.\n\"I'm not going to plead with the guy, but if he's got any humanity he will give me an explanation.\n\"It wasn't random, it couldn't have been more deliberate and targeted. Whether I'll ever find out, I almost have to deal with the possibility that I might not and that is psychologically impacting.\"\nMr Lewis said he was back at work within days of the attack, but said he had struggled with the idea that had he not made it out of the shop his heart attack might never have been revealed as attempted murder.\n\"The drug clears your system, which is why I would have died if I'd stayed in the shop,\" he said.\n\"It would have disappeared and nobody would have looked for a pin prick, it would have been put down as a cardiac arrest.\n\"But the psychology of it, there can't be many victims of such a crime who have to return to the scene of the crime every single day and sit in the same seat where you were attacked.\n\"I do not think it will ever be over and done with unless I am given a reason and I can't imagine what that reason would be.\n\"You rack your brains but you've almost got to not think about it too much because I may never get an explanation.\"\nSouth Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said Harris' employment was terminated in August 2024.\nIt said a review into the storage of medications, including controlled drugs, in cardiac theatres and general theatres was carried out in light of the incident and concluded \"all theatres were fully compliant with national guidance\".\nGet in touch\nTell us which stories we should cover in Yorkshire\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North.\nRelated topics\nMore on this story\nNeedle attack nurse guilty of attempted murder",

        "contents": "Councils across the country have issued warnings about fake QR codes in car parks\nOrganised crime gangs are behind a sharp rise in scams linked to fraudulent QR codes, experts say.\nThe national fraud reporting centre Action Fraud received 1,386 reports of people being targeted last year, compared with 100 in 2019.\nContactless payment hotspots - like parking meters and restaurant menus - are common targets of criminals who stick their own QR codes on signage.\nKatherine Hart, lead officer at the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said: \"We've seen huge amounts lost this way. People have seen their life savings gone and that money is going to finance criminals.\"\nShe said quishing was significantly under-reported and presented a \"huge challenge\" to authorities globally.\n'Hierarchy of criminals'\n\nFraudulent and misleading codes have also been spotted on parcels, in emails and on television.\nPeople who scan them using mobile phones and other electronic devices are directed to websites controlled by the scammers and tricked into handing over data such as bank details.\nMs Hart said some of those placing the codes were likely to be at the bottom of a hierarchy of organised criminals and may not be aware of the implications of their actions.\nAction Fraud statistics obtained by the BBC's Shared Data Unit suggest a rapid growth in this kind of scam, with recorded incidents more than doubling in the UK between 2023 and 2024.\nOver the past five years, Action Fraud received almost 3,000 reports in total, with a fifth of those linked to the Metropolitan Police force area.\nMilton Haworth has refused to use another QR code since falling victim to scammers\nMilton Haworth used his mobile phone to scan a QR code at a council-run car park in Castleford, West Yorkshire.\nIt directed him to download an unauthorised app, from which he agreed a 90p fee to verify bank details.\nBut instead of paying to park, he found himself signed up to a subscription service with a \u00a339 yearly fee and no refunds offered.\n\"I'd assumed I'd paid for my parking but realised it was a scam when I noticed the next day that \u00a339 had gone out of my account,\" he said.\n\"The sign said to use the code to park and I hadn't ever heard of QR codes being used as a scam.\"\nMr Haworth blames the spike in cases on authorities \"not taking this seriously enough\".\nHe said: \"Nobody seems to care, there doesn't seem to be anyone trying to find these people.\n\"It's incumbent on the authorities to go after them but I don't think they do because it's small amounts taken, not multimillions.\n\"But if it's \u00a339 a month, what if there's a million people being duped?\"\n'Stay vigilant'\nMs Hart said victims often lost small amounts initially as those responsible gathered the data they needed to launch a \"secondary scam\".\n\"You might lose \u00a32.99 and a lot of people won't report that and don't realise they've passed on their information to a criminal organisation,\" Ms Hart said.\n\"Days or weeks later, they get a call telling them they've been the victim of a fraud and they can pinpoint a day, because they already have all of the information you shared with them earlier.\n\"They convince you using very coercive tactics that they're from your bank, police or Trading Standards and they want to take everything you've got.\"\nExperts including the National Crime Agency and the National Cyber Security Centre say it is vital that people \"stay vigilant to cyber criminals\".\nKirsty Blackman said the financial loss of QR scams could be compounded because of genuine parking charges going unpaid\nKirsty Blackman, Scottish National Party MP for Aberdeen North, spoke to the BBC after removing fake QR codes from parking machines in the city.\nShe said tackling the problem was \"genuinely difficult\", adding: \"Organised criminals are there to make money in whatever way they can and I think they'll scam people whatever we do. It's about trying to whack the moles as they pop up.\"\nShe said the more victims filed reports with Action Fraud, the better police could take action.\n\"QR codes can be really useful,\" she said. \"My kids' school sends them out regularly to share information, for example. That's why it's difficult for people to tell the difference between a legitimate code and a fake one.\n\"When you're scanning a code to pay for something, that's when you really need to stop and think.\"\nPensioner targeted in \u00a313k station QR code scam\nScammers target drivers with 'cruel hoax' QR codes\nDriver charged \u00a3170 in fake parking code scam\nJoe Hall's girlfriend inadvertently scanned a fraudulent QR code when trying to pay for parking in Luton before Christmas.\nThe couple now refuse to use QR codes after \u00a3400 was taken from her bank account the next day.\nMr Hall said: \"I drove back to the car park and found the code she scanned was a sticker. They print them so everything's the same font and colours as the signage and it blends in.\n\"If you know what you're looking for, you might spot it but a lot of the time, you might not even think about it.\n\"It's so easy for them to make money out of it - there were four others behind my girlfriend doing the same thing as she did.\n\"She got her money back but that's not always the case. They could easily just empty your bank account.\"\n'Rigorous checks'\nNational Car Parks, which runs 800 car parking sites across the UK, is considering removing QR codes from its signage.\nIt said a \"rigorous process\" had already been introduced to prevent its QR codes being compromised, with signs inspected and codes checked every day.\nA spokesman said two of its car parks had been targeted by scammers and the business was \"reviewing options\" to reduce the impact of fraudulent QR codes.\nHe said: \"This could include removing a QR code from our signage that directs customers to a payment page, and instead emphasising the use of our website.\n\"We understand the value of QR codes and will still look to use them where we can safely.\"\nDet Supt Gary Miles, head of the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, encouraged users to \"stay alert\" to signs of fraudulent codes.\n\"You should stop and check before scanning one,\" he said. \"If you're in person, check for signs it has been tampered with, or online, look out for phishing emails or rogue social media posts with QR codes.\n\"We know that QR codes can be used in all aspects of life, online and in-person, however this doesn't stop fraudsters finding new ways to target members of the public.\"\nMore about this story\nThe Shared Data Unit, external makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.\nRead more about the Local News Partnerships here.\nRelated topics\nMore from the BBC Shared Data Unit\nPolice unit dubbed 'authoritarian censor'\nDeadly new drugs found in fake medicines in the UK\nChildren face 'lifetime cost' of council crisis\nRelated internet links\nBBC Shared Data Unit\nActionFraud\nNational Cyber Security Centre",

        "title": "Trump had five tariff goals - has he achieved any of them?",
        "contents": "This video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nWatch: What's behind Trump's 90-day tariffs pause?\nDonald Trump announced a massive tariff plan last week that would have upended the global economic order as well as long-established trading relationships with America's allies.\nBut that plan - or at least a significant part of it - is on ice after the president suspended higher tariffs on most countries for 90 days while leaning into a trade war with China.\nSo with this partial reversal, is Trump any closer to realising his goals on trade? Here's a quick look at five of his key ambitions and where they now stand.\n1) Better trade deals\nWHAT TRUMP SAID: For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike\nTrump's original trade plan packed a big punch that landed around the world, with a flat 10% baseline tariff on everyone (including some uninhabited islands) and additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on the 60 countries that he said were the worst offenders.\nIt sent allies and adversaries scrambling, as they stared down the prospect of a debilitating blow to their economies.\nThe White House has been quick to boast about all the world leaders who have reached out to the president to make deals and offer trade concessions \u2013 \"more than 75\", according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nAlthough the administration hasn't released a list of all the countries that Trump said on Tuesday were \"kissing my ass\" and promising to do anything, the US has announced it is in negotiations with South Korea and Japan, among others.\nTHE TAKEAWAY: America's trading partners have 90 days to strike some sort of agreement with Trump, and the clock is ticking. But the fact that talks are happening indicates that the president has a good chance of getting something for his efforts.\nWhat are tariffs and why is Trump using them?\nWhat does the tariff pause mean for global trade?\n2) Boosting American industry\nWHAT TRUMP SAID: Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country\u2026We will supercharge our domestic industrial base.\nTrump has said for decades that tariffs are an effective way of rebuilding America's manufacturing base by shielding it from unfair foreign competition. While some factories may be able to increase production in current facilities, more substantive efforts take time. And for business leaders to pull the trigger on \"reshoring\" their production lines and investing in new US factories, they will want to know that the rules of the game are relatively stable.\nThe president's on-again, off-again tariff moves over the past week are inherently unstable, however. For the moment, it's difficult to predict where the final tariff levels will land and which industries will receive the greatest protections. It could be car manufacturers and steel producers today, and high-tech electronics companies tomorrow.\nTHE TAKEAWAY: When tariffs are applied and removed seemingly at the president's whim, it's much more likely that companies \u2013 both in the US and abroad \u2013 will hunker down and wait for the dust to settle before making any big commitments.\nThis video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nWatch: Why US markets skyrocketed after Trump tariffs pause\n3) Facing off with China\nWHAT TRUMP SAID: I have great respect for President Xi of China, great respect for China, but they were taking tremendous advantage of us.\nAfter Trump's tariff about-face on Wednesday, several White House officials \u2013 including Treasury Secretary Bessent - were quick to say that Trump's goal was to drop the hammer on the real villain, China.\n\"They are the biggest source of the US trade problems,\" Bessent told reporters, \"and indeed they are the problem for the rest of the world.\nIf Trump wanted a battle of wills with China, testing each side's tolerance for economic and political pain, he got one \u2013 even if the president and his aides have hinted that they are looking for an exit ramp.\nOn Wednesday, Trump said that he blamed past US leaders, not China, for the current trade dispute. The prior day, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president would be \"incredibly gracious\" if China reaches out to make a deal.\nTHE TAKEAWAY: Even if this showdown is one Trump wants, picking a fight with the second-largest economy in the world, with military power to match, comes at enormous risk. And along the way America may have alienated the allies it needs most in such a confrontation.\nWhy Trump is hitting China - and what might happen next\n4) Raising revenue\nWHAT TRUMP SAID: Now it's our turn to prosper, and in so doing, use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt, and it'll all happen very quickly.\nDuring last year's presidential campaign, Trump regularly touted that his proposed tariffs would bring in vast sums in new revenue, which the US could then use to shrink its budget deficit, fund tax cuts and pay for new government programmes.\nA study last year by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimated that a 10% universal tariff \u2013 which is what Trump has landed on for at least the next 90 days \u2013 would generate $2tn in new revenue over the next 10 years.\nTo put that in context, the tax cuts Congress recently included in its non-binding budget blueprint would cost approximately $5tn over the next 10 years, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.\nTHE TAKEAWAY: Trump wanted more tariff revenue, and if he sticks with his baseline tariffs, plus the additional levies on certain imports and larger ones on China, he's going to get it \u2013 at least until Americans switch to more domestic production, when the tariff money gusher could turn to a trickle.\nIs the US making $2bn a day from tariffs?\n5) Lower prices for US consumers\nWHAT TRUMP SAID: Ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers. This will be indeed the golden age of America.\nAnalysts and experts have offered a grab bag of other explanations about why Trump made such an aggressive move on trade last week. Was he trying to drive down interest rates, or devalue the US dollar or bring the world to the table for a new, global agreement on trade? The president himself hasn't spoken much about those kinds of elaborate schemes.\nOne thing he has talked about relentlessly, however, is his desire to lower costs for American consumers - and he has promised that his trade policy will help address this. While energy prices dipped in the week since Trump announced his tariff plan, that may have been a result of fears that the trade wars could trigger a global recession.\nThe consensus among economists is that new tariffs will drive up consumer prices, as tariffs are tacked on to the price of imports and, eventually, when there is less competition for US-made products. Last year, the Tax Foundation estimated that a 10% universal tariff would increase costs for American households by an average of $1,253 in its first year. Economists also warn that lower-income Americans will be hardest hit.\nTHE TAKEAWAY: An increase in prices is an arrow moving in the wrong direction \u2013 and it represents an enormous potential liability for both Trump's political standing and his party's future electoral prospects.\nGet in touch\nAre you concerned about the impact of tariffs on your business or personal finances?

But even accounting for the President's roll back, the US has still erected a massive protectionist tariff wall, not seen since the 1930s.\nThe world is left with a universal 10% tariff, irrespective of whether that country (for example the UK or Australia) actually sells less to the US than the US sells to it.\nThere is now no difference between the EU, which clearly does have a massive trade deficit in goods and was preparing to retaliate, and the UK.\nCould President Trump push ahead with tariffs on medicines next?\nThere is also an anxious wait to find out what comes next. One of the questions is whether President Trump pushes ahead with tariffs on medicines, the UK's second biggest goods export.\nPlus there is potential logistical chaos on the cards from a little-noticed multi-million dollar port tax for every cargo vessel docking in the US that was \"made in China\". That is more than half of the global merchant fleet - and it is due next week.\nEven with Trump's stated 90 day pause on implementing higher tariffs, there remains too much uncertainty for companies to go through the rigmarole of rerouting global trade.\nThe China fallout\nThe central issue now, however, is that the world's two great economic superpowers are facing off against each other like rutting stags.\nTariffs at these sky-high rates are massively hitting business between two nations which together account for around 3% of the entire world's trade. The main motorway of the global economy is effectively shut.\nThe visible tangible consequences of all this will become very real very quickly: Chinese factories will close, workers will stroll from plant to plant looking for work.\nBeijing will need to organise a stimulus package to account for the loss of whole percentage points of GDP, the kind of thing that happens when a natural disaster flattens a major city. Painful, but manageable at a cost, though not forever.\nChina is expected to launch a stimulus package to make up for the economic damage\nMeanwhile the US will see consumer prices surge. President Trump might try to order these US companies not to raise prices, but the effect will come through soon enough.\nIn theory this will be in sharp contrast to what is happening in other countries in the world. Across the border in Canada, or in Europe, not only will there not be such China-sourced price rises, there could be price cuts.\nFrom trade wars to currency wars\nTrade wars on this scale do not stay confined to the flow of goods. They tend to become currency wars.\nWhat we saw this week was the trade turmoil spread to credit markets, especially the US bond market, having already hit share prices.\nIndeed there was an invaluable reveal for the game theory of this conflict. The Trump administration revealed a key pressure point with its concern about the \"yippy\" - as Trump called it - bond market.\nAs trading in US government debt continued overnight in Asia, the effective interest rate on these bonds rose to 5%.\nThis sort of borrowing should not move in such an erratic fashion.\nThe last time this happened was in the \"Dash for Cash\", the key moment of financial fragility at the very beginning of the pandemic. The world was focussed on life or death in March 2020, but this potential further crisis was alleviated only by emergency action.\nEffectively, the President's row back was a form of emergency policy change.\nWas the Chinese government behind this rash of US government bond sales in Asia? Probably not. However, what happened on Wednesday highlighted a vulnerability for Trump.\nWhat the bond markets were telling Trump is that they are deeply sceptical about his tariff policy\nChina is the second biggest holder of US government debt in the world and if it chose to, dumping all that debt would be catastrophic for America. But doing so would be a form of mutually assured economic destruction - the losses for China would be huge.\nMore importantly, what the bond markets were telling Trump is that they are deeply sceptical about his tariff policy.\nThe US does have the Federal Reserve, which does have some power to tranquillise bond markets. But right now it does not look like its chairman Jerome Powell will ride to the rescue.\nThe bond market scepticism echoes the sentiment of the ascendant Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. He is now pushing for Trump to reach trade deals with their allies because the US needs them to take on China.\nThe bond market doubts echo the scepticism of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent\nGiven the US was previously calling these same close allies cheaters, looters and pillagers, there is no way this was the strategy all along.\nThis does matter. The US needs the EU, UK, the rest of the G7 on side in terms of China. China probably needs those countries just to stay neutral, and carry on soaking up its exports.\nThe rest of the world has seen Trump's team struggle to explain tariffing penguin islands or poor African economies and the President himself recirculating the suggestion he was crashing stock markets on purpose. And they've witnessed the fact that the tariff rates were changed after they came into effect and also the absurd nature of the equation used to calculate them.\nIt's in this context that Trump's handling of the situation has handed leverage back to the rest of the world, because neither friend nor foe will know quite what they are negotiating  with this America.\nThere is a calm, welcomed by all, but it could be rather brief.\nMore from InDepth\nTrump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy\nWar has changed Zelensky - but now is the time for him to transform again\nDavid Dimbleby: I thought the free market was with us forever - then Trump came along\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "title": "Will iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?",
        "contents": "The world's most popular gadgets - phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches - could be about to get a lot more expensive in the US.\nMany of them are made in China, which now faces a 145% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy.\nThe effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars.\nAnd if the tariffs impact the value of the dollar, it could become more expensive to import iPhones and other devices around the world - potentially leading to higher prices in UK shops.\nBen Wood of CCS Insight told the BBC that if tariffs remain in place, Apple may raise iPhone prices globally when the next iteration is launched.\n\"It is unlikely the company would want to have differentiated pricing globally,\" he said - as the tech giant would want to avoid people buying the device cheaply in the UK and selling it on for profit in the US.\nThough others say they believe it could result in cheaper prices if firms which normally send their goods to the US instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK.\nAnd there may be a significant change if the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers globally - longer contracts to spread out the cost of the device.\nWhile a phone contract may typically last two years, Mr Wood said some firms already offer four year deals, and he believed \"we might see five-year contracts\" in 2025.\n\"One could argue it is almost like having a mortgage for your smartphone,\" he said.\nWhere are iPhones made?\nThe US is a major market for iPhones and Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research, external.\nIt says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India.\nAlong with fellow smartphone giants such as Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid over-reliance on China in recent years.\nIndia and Vietnam emerged as frontrunners for additional manufacturing hubs.\nAs tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days.\nReuters reported on Thursday, external that Apple chartered cargo flights to ship more than 600 tons of iPhones from India to the US.\nAmid Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs, including those levied on India, the country may be set to benefit from an iPhone manufacturing boost.\nThe BBC has approached Apple for comment on the impact of tariffs on their operations and prices, but has not had any response yet.\nHow exposed is Apple to tariffs?\nTrump and his advisors have said the aim of its tariffs are to encourage more US manufacturing.\nHowever, the tech industry relies on a global network of suppliers for product components and assembly.\nThis, and finding skilled workers to match the fast pace and low cost of production in Asia, means relocating supply chains is no simple feat.\nApple committed a $500bn (\u00a3385bn) investment in the US in February - which the Trump administration believes will result in more homegrown manufacturing.\nBut Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said shifting parts of its supply chain from cheaper manufacturing hubs in Asia to the US will take a lot of time, and money.\n\"The reality is it would take 3 years and $30 billion dollars in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with major disruption in the process,\" he wrote on X on 3 April, external.\nWhat are tariffs and why is Trump using them?\nWill iPhone prices go up?\nApple have not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices.\nSome analysts believe Apple is in a more fortunate position than others, having reaped more money from its products than it has spent on making them.\n\"As a company with lucrative margins on its devices, Apple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\" says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee.\nBut he notes the company's strong branding and popularity may allow it to pass some costs to consumers without too much backlash.\n\"The brand commands better loyalty than its competitors, and it is unlikely that a manageable price increase will send these customers fleeing into the arms of Android-based competitors.\"\nSome estimates suggest iPhone prices in the US could as much as triple if costs were passed to consumers.\nFollowing Trump's tariff increase on China to 125%, the cost for a China-made iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB storage would have surged from $1,199 to $1,999, according to estimates by investment banking firm UBS.\nThey estimate a less significant increase on the iPhone 16 Pro 128GB storage - which is made in India - by five percent from $999 to $1046.\nWhile some analysts such as Dan Ives have suggested that the cost of a \"Made in USA\" iPhone could soar to as much as $3500.\nWhat can consumers do about it?\nThere's still plenty of uncertainty about what happens next, and how companies like Apple will respond to tariffs remains to be seen.\nThis hasn't stopped some US customers reportedly rushing to Apple stores to buy its smartphones, external.\nThe BBC spoke to shoppers outside an Apple Store in New York who had bought products in fear of a potential price hike.\nAnthony Cacioppo, a 53-year-old DJ and security technician, purchased the new iPhone.\n\"I really didn't need a phone... but I'm not ready to pay double the price,\" he said.\nBruce Conroy, a hair stylist, told the BBC that even if prices had risen considerably he \"would have stuck with Apple products\" - though potentially delayed his purchase of a new iPad.\n\"I bought it because the tariffs are coming, I want to buy before the prices go up and I expect they will,\" said Julia Baumann, a personal finance editor, of her new MacBook.\nJulia told the BBC she was expecting costs to rise across a wealth of areas, from groceries to gadgets\nWe will likely have to wait until the autumn to see how much the next iPhone will cost.\nBut if it looks like costs incurred by tariffs will result in higher price tags, some may look to rival handsets or second-hand devices.\nCCS Insight estimates that 5.5m second-hand smartphones will be sold in the UK in 2025, representing 29.7% of the total market.\nThe iPhone remains one of the most expensive smartphones on the market - and brands such as Google and Samsung offer phones with similar features at a lower cost.\nThe other option, and perhaps the most cost-effective, could be for people to skip upgrades to newer iPhone models and look to slightly older, cheaper versions.\n\"The path of least resistance would be to keep the smartphone they already have for longer,\" said Mr Wood.\nAdditional reporting by Paul Sargeant, Tom Finn and Pratiksha Ghildial.\nRelated topics",

        "title": "Bulldozers to move in on 'Scotland's Chernobyl'",
        "contents": "This video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\n'Scotland's Chernobyl' - Inside Scotland's derelict Clune Park estate\nA derelict housing estate dubbed \"Scotland's Chernobyl\" for its eerie ghost-town like appearance is finally about to be razed to the ground.\nThe tenements at Clune Park in the Inverclyde town of Port Glasgow were built a century ago as housing for shipyard workers but have lain mostly abandoned for years.\nA stand-off between private landlords and the local council has thwarted redevelopment, leaving the site frozen in time with just a handful of tenants remaining.\nDemolition contractors are expected on site within days, preparing to take down a third of the buildings, including a fire-damaged school and crumbling church, after they were condemned as structurally unsafe.\nThe site has often attracted urban explorers and photographers despite warnings of the potential dangers\nThe run-down estate has in recent years become a magnet for urban explorers and photographers, forcing the authorities to step up security patrols and issue danger warnings.\nComparisons have often been made with the Ukrainian city of Pripyat, abandoned after the 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear plant led to a huge radiation leak.\nClune Park was first described as Scotland's Chernobyl more than a decade ago, and the name has stuck. Local politicians say it was an easy badge to apply to the area because of its desolate nature.\nBeyond superficial appearances, though, their stories are very different.\nAlmost all of the tenement blocks on the estate are now empty and derelict\nThe red sandstone-fronted tenement blocks radiating off the town's Robert Street were built just after World War One by shipbuilder Lithgows to house its workforce.\nBack then the waterfronts of Port Glasgow and neighbouring Greenock were filled with shipyards.\nIt was densely packed housing - 430 bedsits and flats, mostly in four-storey blocks - but there was a church, a school, local shops and a sense of community.\nClune Park Church, now a rubble-filled shell, is one of the first buildings to be demolished\nFormer resident Karen Thomson and her husband Allan bought their first flat together as a married couple in Wallace Street in 1992, and stayed for six years.\n\"It was lovely - the neighbours were nice. It was a nice area, it was very friendly - everybody knew everybody,\" recalled Karen.\n\"It was very busy and the houses were sought after. It was very hard to get one of the houses in the area.\"\nBut Clyde shipbuilding had long been in decline, people were moving out and the cheap flats were increasingly bought up as rental investments.\nKaren said: \"The area was starting to fall down, they weren't keeping maintenance on it - the area started going to pot. I don't think they were putting money into it.\"\nClune Park fell into a spiral of decline, with property values plummeting further as it acquired a reputation for drug use and crime.\nMarshal Craig is one of a handful of remaining Clune Park residents\nRetired forestry worker Marshal Craig, 73, is one of a handful of remaining residents.\nHe's lived at Clune Park for 20 years and his current rented flat on the edge of the estate is in far better condition than most. He describes it as the \"posh end\".\nSome years ago he was hospitalised from smoke inhalation caused by one of the frequent deliberate fires in the abandoned buildings.\nBut as a keen reader, guitar player and nature lover, he values the quietness.\n\"There's seventeen different species of tree across the road,\" he said.\n\"At night you've got the foxes and owls and all the rest of it. I love that.\"\nA handful of the estate's flats are in good condition - and still occupied\nHis block is not yet scheduled for demolition and his landlord is in no hurry to sell, so for the moment Marshal is staying put.\nHis home is well-decorated, boasts a large bay window and a Chesterfield sofa - all in stark contrast to the dereliction of the empty flats just a stone's throw away.\n\"People go how can you live there, are you not scared?\" he says.\n\"I'm not scared. I'm a big guy - or I used to be. It suits me but it doesn't suit everybody and it doesn't suit the council.\"\nA regeneration plan drawn up more than a decade ago proposed total demolition and rebuilding but ran into the buffers when some owners mounted a successful legal challenge.\nThe buildings of Wallace Street, one of the Clune Park streets, are now entirely unoccupied\nSince then the council has steadily bought up the flats to the point where it now owns about two thirds of the properties.\nThe first phase of demolition will see the church, the school and 15 of the 45 tenement blocks taken down, 138 flats in total - but the plan is for them all to go eventually.\nThe former Clune Park Primary School is one of the oldest buildings on the site, founded in 1887 - the year of Queen Victoria's jubilee.\nBusts of Victoria and Prince Albert jut out from either side of the doorway, while higher on the wall is the Port Glasgow coat of arms, a three-masted sailing ship and the Latin motto \"Ter Et Quater Anno Revisens Aequor Atlanticum Impune\".\nIt translates as \"Three and four times a year revisiting the Atlantic with impunity\" - a reference to the ships that once fetched huge logs from Canada, to be seasoned in the \"timber ponds\" of the Clyde before being used for shipbuilding.\nClune Park School was gutted by fire in 2023 but these images, taken in 2020, show how the Victorian building was already being reclaimed by nature\nBusts of Queen Victorian and Prince Albert look out from the doorway of the old Clune Park school, now badly damaged by fire\nMurals on the old school corridors, photographed before the fire damage\nThe school closed in 2008 but the gym equipment remained in place a decade later\n1 of 4\nThe demolition contractors say they will try to preserve the best stonework features by removing them by hand.\nWhen the school closed in 2008, former pupils reminisced on social media about the grand staircase, the comforting smell of wooden floors and favourite teachers.\nThe building is B-listed - meaning it has regional importance.\nUnder the council's original regeneration plan, the frontage would have been retained and the site developed into an energy centre, providing low emission heating.\nBut a fire in 2023 gutted the school and it is now deemed beyond repair.\nThe huge roof trusses from the church now are now piled up on Robert Street\nThe church was previously photographed in 2020 when the roof was largely intact\n1 of 4\nNext to the school stands the shell of Clune Park Church, built in 1905 from red sandstone in the late Gothic \"Modern Movement\" style of architecture.\nIt has an ornate art nouveau-style window and, like the school, is B-listed by Historic Environment Scotland.\nBut the building's decay is now so far advanced, permission has been granted for demolition.  The roof is long gone and huge timber roof trusses that once supported it have been stacked up in the street outside.\nThe Clune Park tenements are unusual in the west of Scotland in that they have flat concrete roofs which the council says are suffering from \"corrosion swelling\".\nInverclyde Council leader Stephen McCabe says back in the 1990s refurbishment was considered but no funding was available and a complete rebuild was thought better value.\nCouncil leader Stephen McCabe says a \"war of attrition\" has taken place to buy up the flats\nBut he says the council has faced a long \"war of attrition\" to identify owners and buy up the properties, with valuations often coming in at just a few thousand pounds.\nUltimately the plan is to replace the 430 flats with 165 new affordable homes with the investment coming from a social landlord.\n\"The start of the demolition will be a real sign that we're getting there and we will ultimately demolish all of those properties,\" said McCabe.\n\"That will be a day for celebration\".\nBut with around 100 flats still in private hands there's no clear timescale for when that will happen.\nThe demolition contractors expect to start taking down the first buildings later this month.\nWhile it marks the beginning of the end for \"Scotland's Chernobyl\" it may be some time yet before a new Clune Park rises from the rubble.\nRelated topics",

        "title": "Will Poulter and Kit Connor: We shaved each other's heads before filming Warfare",
        "contents": "Will Poulter and Kit Connor are part of the cast for the film Warfare, about soldiers fighting in Iraq\nThe young cast of Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza\u2019s film Warfare had to bond pretty quickly, to play a US military unit whose lives depended on each other, during the Iraq war in 2006.\nFamiliarity was crucial, so before filming began, the cast were sent on a three-week military bootcamp.\nThey lived together, learning military jargon and gun safety and were pushed beyond their limits - all of which brought them closer together.\nFirst off though, they agreed to shave each other's heads to look the part, boosting trust and familiarity.\n\"We shaved our heads on day one, and got tattoos at the end of the process, so it bookended the experience,\" Poulter tells the BBC.\nThe actor, who recently appeared in The Bear and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, plays Captain Eric, who was part of a group of US soldiers and Iraqi scouts on a surveillance mission.\nWe see how it goes wrong, with devastating consequences.\nThe close bonds between the soldiers on-screen extended to real friendships among the actors\nHeartstopper star Connor plays newcomer Tommy, hitting home how young the soldiers were - he's just turned 21, the same age Tommy was at the time.\nThe actor says the decision to get a shared tattoo with his castmates after filming wrapped was a \"no-brainer\". The casts of The Avengers and The Lord of the Rings did the same thing after their final films.\nWarfare's actors decided their tattoo would say \"Call On Me\", external, to reflect their brotherhood, while referencing Erik Prydz's 2004 dance hit, which kicks the film off.\nThe cast features some other big names, including Reservation Dogs' D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Sh\u014dgun's Cosmo Jarvis, Stranger Things and the forthcoming Beatles biopic's Joseph Quinn, and Riverdale's Charles Melton.\n\"It was really formative for me,\" Connor says about his time  on the film. \"I've made friends I really do believe I will know for a long time.\n\"We all wanted to commemorate it - we are so proud of the work we've done together.\"\nKit Connor plays young recruit Tommy\nThe movie is based entirely on a real-life mission that took place during the Iraq war, and is built on the memories of the US soldiers who were there.\nThe group was embedded in the home of an ordinary Iraqi family, who we briefly see in the film, in Ramadi - an area controlled by Al-Qaeda forces.\nThe military's goal had been to slip into and observe the area under the cover of darkness, to ensure the safe passage of ground forces there the next day.\nWhat they didn't know what that they were next door to an insurgent house, making them the target of an attack.\nShot in real-time, Warfare has no music or flashbacks, so there's no let-up for the audience. You're dropped into the thick of the action for the whole film.\nThe soldiers in command have to make split-second decisions amid the pain and chaos, with the Iraqi family caught in the crossfire.\nOscar nominee Garland, whose back catalogue includes the 28 Days film franchise and Ex Machina, got the idea for Warfare when he was making last year's film Civil War.\nHe was working on the battle scenes with Hollywood stunt man and gunfight co-ordinator Ray Mendoza.\n\"During the edit process of Civil War, I was able to really focus on some of the work Ray had done, and how sophisticated and how nuanced it was,\" Garland recalls.\nThey got chatting about Mendoza's previous life as a US Navy Seal, and about the Ramadi operation, where he was its communications officer.\nMendoza said he'd always wanted to make a film about that mission.\nAlex Garland [L] and ex-combat veteran Ray Mendoza wanted to recreate what war was really like\nThe veteran had a very big reason for wanting to recreate what happened that day - to help replace the lost memories of his colleague Elliott Miller.\nMiller, a former Navy Seal, was so badly injured in Ramadi that he suffered traumatic brain injury and memory loss, external, and had to have a leg amputated.\nDuring the mission, Mendoza carried the unconscious soldier to the rescue tank that ultimately saved his life.\n\"Elliott doesn't remember it, and when he woke up, he had a lot of questions,\" Mendoza says.\n\"No matter how many maps we drew, or how many times we wrote it out - without that core memory, I think he's had a hard time.\n\"It just raised more questions than answers. So I wanted to recreate this one.\"\nSo Garland and Mendoza decided to make Warfare together, sharing writing and directing credits, and dedicating the film to Miller.\nCosmo Jarvis [R] said they wanted to \"create a living snapshot\" of the mission for real-life soldier Elliott Miller\nThe crucial question is whether seeing the film helped Miller piece things together.\n\"It did, yeah - he was a sponge,\" Mendoza says.\n\"We walked him through it - he had a lot of questions, he's got kids that have questions.\n\"It's now a film memory, but it's as close as he's gonna have \u2013 he's super grateful.\"\nMiller was played by Jarvis, who calls him \"a funny guy... he's great - a living embodiment of perseverance\".\nIt was a \"unique situation to be in when you're entrusted with portraying somebody that's sitting right across from you\", Jarvis said, about having the person he was playing actually on set.\n\"But because he didn't remember [what happened], a lot of my references had to come from his colleagues.\"\nTaylor John Smith, Charles Melton and Alex Brockdorff also star in the film\nThe soldiers' casting has caused some excitement online, with some publications breathily calling the actors \"all of the internet's boyfriends\" and \"red hot rising stars\".\nGarland arches an eyebrow at this, and Mendoza jumps in to talk about why those actors were chosen.\n\"I've said this to them, so I'm not trying to offend them, but we weren't looking for the best actors. They're all great actors. We were looking for the right actors,\" he says.\n\"So what that means is their willingness to push their bodies past a comfort level that they're maybe not used to. 'You're gonna be exhausted. You're gonna be required to rely on other people. It's not about you, it's about the team'.\n\"And the ones that jump at that opportunity, you're like, 'Yep, that's the attitude that we need'.\"\nThere's no let-up for the audience watching Will Poulter and D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai's characters in action\nCollating and cross-checking the soldiers' memories was a big job, largely undertaken by Garland.\n\"I think there's an inherent value in attempting to be honest and truthful about something as serious and significant as war,\" he says.\nHe shot the film in a studio in a suburb north of London, on a former World War Two airfield, making it in real-time to recreate \"a real incident of combat... as honestly, forensically and accurately as possible\".\nNot surprisingly, while sharing credits with Garland, former US Navy Seal Mendoza ran the actors' bootcamp.\nHe was played by Woon-A-Tai, who calls him \"a brilliant instructor who instilled a lot of confidence in us\", while also making gun safety a top priority.\nThe actor was also fascinated by the narrative not being \"dramatised or Hollywoodised\".\n\"To see these guys not obey orders - and do what they needed to save their platoon was interesting to me,\" he says, talking about the soldiers' evacuation process.\nWill Poulter hopes the film shows \"how the consequences of war are characterised by a lot of loss\"\nMendoza thinks the film may also help veterans who are struggling to express what warfare can be like.\n\"Some of these things are harder to explain in words,\" he says. \"So art imagery is how I'm able to communicate that.\"\nConnor echoes this, saying: \"A lot of these men are very much less inclined to talk about themselves in these situations, whether it be to be due to humility, or a difficulty in really articulating it.\n\"A lot of them just don't really enjoy talking about their involvement.\"\nThe film has been called \"the most harrowing \u2013 and honest \u2013 depiction of modern combat ever made\" by the Telegraph, external, while the New Yorker said, external it offers a \"hyperrealist rebuke of the American war movie\".\nThe Guardian said, external the \"film-makers' message gets lost in the deafening blizzard of battle\", while Empire added, external: \"It may well be cinema's most effective, purest anti-war film: there is no sentimentality, no hand-wringing, but most significantly not a second of it makes war look cool, or attractive.\"\nPoulter says he admires the film-makers' determination to make Warfare purely factual.\n\"Hopefully this film contributes to a better understanding of just how negative, and how the consequences of war are characterised by a lot of loss...\n\"I think this is as much an anti-war film as you can possibly hope to see.\"\nWarfare is out in cinemas on Friday, 18 April.\nRelated topics\nMore on this story\nHow invasion plunged Iraq into decades of chaos",

        "contents": "Carwin and his mother, Carmin, were celebrating seeing each for the first time in three years when they were caught up in the nightclub disaster\nAt 01:00 on Tuesday morning Carwin Javie Molleja was dancing with his mother in Santo Domingo's Jet Set nightclub when he noticed something fall from the ceiling.\nAt the time, he didn't think much of it. \"No-one thought that because a small stone fell the entire roof was going to collapse,\" he says.\nThe percussionist, who had moved to the Dominican Republic eight years earlier, was out with his mother, Carmin, and friends to see a concert by merengue singer Rubby P\u00e9rez.\nIt was the first time Carwin, 32, and his mother had seen each other in three years and it was meant to be a night of joy and celebration.\nBut in the early hours of Tuesday morning, disaster struck.\n\"What I have in my head are the screams, the loud sound of the ceiling falling in, my mom's screams asking me if I'm OK, me asking her if she's OK,\" Carwin recalls.\n\"Everything happened so fast. I guess I closed my eyes and my instinct was to hug my mum.\"\nAt least 218 people were killed when the ceiling at Jet Set nightclub collapsed early on Tuesday morning\nBoth Carwin and his mother, who had been standing near the stage, were struck on the head by pieces of falling ceiling, but were lucky to avoid serious injury. Rubby Perez was among those killed.\nIn the chaos that quickly unfolded, Carwin managed to find a door through which he and his mother escaped outside.\nBut his friend Jessica and her sister were still in the club. Desperate to find them, he decided to go back inside.\nInside the club, Carwin desperately shouted Jessica's name but no one answered.\nHe says he felt powerless to help those who had become trapped under the debris.\n\"The stones were huge. I felt useless.\"\nCarwin says he then repeatedly went out of the building, where he'd try to call paramedics, then return inside to shout his friend's name and call her phone.\n\"After that, the calls stopped going through.\"\nCarwin and his mother and friends had been celebrating in the nightclub before disaster struck\nCarwin describes the aftermath of the collapse as \"total chaos\".\n\"People were going crazy,\" he says.\n\"They were pulling out injured people. I saw when they pulled out the saxophonist who died.\"\nWithin minutes of the collapse, emergency services arrived, as ambulances and stretchers \"kept coming\".\nCarwin says he remained at the scene for about an hour and a half after the collapse.\nIn that time, he says he didn't see any machinery arriving to remove the debris.\nHe says he wanted to continue trying to find his friend, but needed to take home his mother, who was in pain.\n\"I needed to get her home and calm her down.\"\nLater that day, Jessica and her sister's lifeless bodies were found among the rubble. At least 221 people were killed in the disaster.\nCarwin says he regrets not having been able to do more for his friend.\n\"It was horrible not being able to help her. I yelled her name, but she didn't answer. It feels awful not being able to do anything.\"\nWith reporting by Isabel Caro and Alicia Hern\u00e1ndez.\nRelated topics\nMore on this story\nDespair as death toll from Dominican Republic nightclub collapse rises\nGirl, 17, whose dad is lost in nightclub rubble spends birthday at scene\nDominican Republic nightclub collapse kills 113",

        "title": "What goes on inside toddlers' brains? A pioneering project is trying to find out",
        "contents": "Researchers are using specially designed games and brain-scanning 'hats' to work out how children develop key skills\nTwo-year-old Henry is completely transfixed by the iPad in front of him. Every time a smiley face appears he taps the screen - and his tap transforms the face into a cartoon of a dancing animal.\nIt looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.\nIt is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.\nScientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain.\nThe development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.\nBut what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.\nThe waiting room is full of toys and games, set up especially for young children\nA lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.\nFor a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.\n\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"\nChildren who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains.\n\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"\nDuring the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.\nThe games help researchers measure how skills like working memory and impulse control develop in babies and toddlers\nKey to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.\n\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"\nThis skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school.\n\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"\nHundreds of babies and toddlers taking part in this new study are the children of people who have been studied since the 1990s,\nIn another room, Jackson, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory.\nA research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jackson can keep all the stickers he finds.\n\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.\n\"These are what I call 'building blocks' of really important skills.\"\nThe study will also assess language development and processing speed - a measure of how quickly children pick up new information.\nThis findings of this study could help scientists support children who might struggle academically or socially, before they start school\nThe Children of the 90s project is now 35 years old. Focused primarily on health, by tracking 14,500 children born between 1991 and 1992, it has revealed insights into obesity, autism and, more recently, the effect of the pandemic on mental health.\nThe project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.\nOne study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact, external on their health and development.\nThanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.\nAnd the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind, external.\nIn this latest study \u2013 of the children of the children of the 90s \u2013 scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school.\nEmily (pictured here as a young child in her mother's arms) is a child of the 90s\nEmily, who was studied as a child of the 90s, is Henry's mum. Today, her young son sits on her lap as he works on one of the research team's carefully designed puzzles.\n\"We've both been a part of this since birth,\" Emily says. \"It wasn't a choice for me at the start - my mum signed me up. But it is now, and I just think it's fascinating.\"\nHelping children to thrive in the future is the aim, Dr Holmboe says. Because when children start school, she explains \"a lot of things are already set.\n\"This is the groundwork that will help us support children at the right time.\"\nHenry and Jackson finish their puzzles and games and take off their brain-scanning hats.\n\"My boys just love coming here,\" says Emily. \"They love all the toys - they get free snacks. So I'll continue coming just as long as they want to.\n\"Why wouldn't you want to be part of this and maybe help future generations?\"\nCity's 'world-beating' study awarded \u00a35.2m grant\nFirst gathering in decade for 1990s children study\nGet our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

        "contents": "Rifaat Radwan filmed the incident in which he and 14 other emergency workers were shot dead by Israeli troops\n\"My heart and soul died when Rifaat was killed,\" says Hajjah Umm Mohammed, the mother of a Palestinian paramedic who was one of 15 emergency workers killed by Israeli troops in southern Gaza last month.\nRifaat Radwan, 23, was travelling in a Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) ambulance in a convoy of emergency vehicles when it came under fire on the outskirts of Rafah on 23 March.\n\"I never expected him to be killed, especially since the area was classified as 'green', meaning safe and open to ambulances,\" she adds.\nThe Israeli military initially claimed the troops opened fire because the convoy approached them \"suspiciously\" in darkness without headlights or flashing emergency lights.\nHowever, video filmed by Rifaat and found on his phone after his body was recovered, showed the vehicles' lights were on as they answered a call to help wounded people.\n\"Forgive me, mother... this is the path I chose to help people,\" Rifaat can be heard saying in the video shortly before he was killed, amid the sound of heavy gunfire.\nUmm Mohammed believes he was asking for her forgiveness because he knew she would never see him again.\n\"I entrusted Rifaat to God every time he went out to work,\" she says. \"He was brave, travelling across Gaza from north to south.\"\nThis video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nGaza medics killing video analysed by BBC Verify\nRifaat began volunteering with the PRCS after Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza following Hamas's unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023.\nUmm Mohammed says her son enjoyed humanitarian work.\n\"He even transported the wounded to cross into Egypt for treatment through the Rafah crossing.\"\nUmm Mohammed explains that on the day he died, Rifaat had gone out with an ambulance after reports of several killed in an Israeli air strike.\n\"I didn't know he would be one of them [too],\" she says.\nIt was a week before his body and those of his colleagues were found buried in a shallow grave on 30 March.\n\"Instead of celebrating Eid al-Fitr with Rifaat, we went with the Red Cross to collect his body from Nasser hospital in Khan Younis to bury him,\" she recalls.\n\"It was badly decomposed and they wouldn't allow me to see it.\"\nUmm Mohammed says he was an \"absolutely beautiful\" human being and the sole supporter of her and his father after all his siblings got married.\nIsraeli army fired more than 100 shots in Gaza medics' killing, audio suggests\nRed Crescent calls for inquiry into Israel's killing of Gaza paramedics\nIsrael changes account of Gaza medic killings after video showed deadly attack\nFollowing the discovery of the video footage, an Israeli military official changed its initial account that claimed the vehicles approached without their lights on. The official said the person who gave the account was \"mistaken\".\nThe official also said the troops perceived the emergency workers as a threat because of an earlier encounter in the area, and that at least six of those killed were Hamas operatives, without providing any evidence.\nThe troops buried the bodies, including Rifaat's, in sand to protect them from wild animals, the official said.\nThey were not uncovered until a week after the incident because international agencies, including the UN, could not organise safe passage to the area or locate the spot.\nWhen the UN-led team found the bodies they also discovered Rifaat's mobile phone containing footage of the incident.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has promised a \"thorough examination\" of the incident, saying it would \"understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation\".\nThe PRCS has alleged that the emergency workers were targeted in a \"series of deliberate attacks\" which constituted a \"full-fledged war crime\", and demanded an independent international investigation.\n\"We need justice for the victims. We need to ensure that all of those who are responsible are held to account. Without this, the crimes will continue to happen,\" PRCS spokeswoman Nebal Farsakh said on Wednesday.\n\"I have already lost 27 PRCS colleagues. All of them were killed while doing their humanitarian work. All of them were killed while wearing the Red Crescent emblem. This is not acceptable. It should never, ever have happened. We are not targets. And international humanitarian law is clear \u2013 humanitarians, medical personnel should be respected and protected.\"\nRifaat's fellow medic, Munther Abed, said he survived the attack by diving to the floor in the back of his ambulance\nMunther Abed, a paramedic who survived the incident, says he and his colleagues were fired at without warning.\n\"I dropped to the floor in the back of the vehicle and didn't hear any sound from my colleagues except their death gasps,\" he told the BBC last week.\n\"Then, Israeli special forces arrested me, pinning my head to the ground so I couldn't see what happened to my team.\"\nHolding back tears, Munther added: \"When I found out they were all martyred, it crushed me. They were my second family... my brothers, my friends, my loved ones.\n\"I wished I had died from the horror of what I saw.\"\nHe says his phone was confiscated when he was detained.\n\"They interrogated me for 15 hours with beatings, insults, and both physical and verbal torture,\" he adds.\nThe BBC has put his claims to the IDF, but it is yet to respond.\nThe PRCS said the area the emergency workers were in had not been classified by the Israeli military as a \"red zone\", which meant no prior co-ordination was required to access the site, and that the video showed that Israeli military vehicles had not been visible in the area.\nIt said preliminary forensic reports showed that the paramedics were killed by \"multiple gunshot wounds to the upper parts of the bodies\", which it described as \"further evidence of deliberate killing\".\nIt also dismissed the IDF's internal inquiry and rejected the IDF's accusation that Hamas operatives were among those killed.\nRifaat Radwan's father did not allow his mother, Umm Mohammed, to see his body\nThe IDF said in a statement on Monday that its Chief of Staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, had been presented with the findings of the initial inquiry into the incident and instructed that it be \"pursued in greater depth and completed in the coming days by the general staff investigation mechanism\".\n\"All the claims raised regarding the incident will be examined through the mechanism and presented in a detailed and thorough manner for a decision on how to handle the event,\" it added.\nAbout 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage in the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023.\nMore than 50,750 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nA ceasefire deal announced in January collapsed in March and there are currently 59 hostages still held in Gaza, 24 of whom are believed to be still alive.\nRelated topics",

        "contents": "The oldest surviving victim of the Post Office Horizon scandal has rejected an increased offer of compensation, saying it is \"still not good enough\".\nBetty Brown, 92, was originally offered less than a third of what she had claimed for, but she has now received a new offer of 60%.\nHowever the former sub-postmistress told the BBC justice was still being denied.\nPost Office minister Gareth Thomas, who had previously promised to look at her case, said it was always the government's priority to pay as much redress as it could.\nBetty said she was forced out of her branch in Country Durham in 2003 after she and her late husband spent more than \u00a350,000 of their savings to cover shortfalls that did not exist.\nIt was the faulty software that made it look like money was missing from their branch.\nHer post office had been one of the most successful in the region but she was later forced to sell it at a loss.\nThe Horizon IT system was responsible for more than 900 sub-postmasters being wrongfully accused of theft, with many being prosecuted and some even being sent to jail. The scandal has been described as one of the widest miscarriages of justice in the UK, and was the subject of ITV drama \"Mr Bates vs The Post Office\".\n\"It absolutely destroyed my whole life,\" she told the BBC.\nShe thanked Mr Thomas for helping her but said there was \"still a long way to go to get the justice that we were promised\".\nBetty has been waiting 26 years for things to be put right.\n\"We're just getting fobbed off. The evidence is all there,\" she said.\nMore than \u00a3892m has now been paid to over 6,200 claimants across four different compensation schemes, according to the latest government figures.\nBut a group of MPs in January said compensation is not being paid quickly enough, and called for changes to the way redress was being delivered.\nMrs Brown was one of the original 555 victims who took part in the landmark group legal action led by Alan Bates against the post office. And she is seeking her compensation via the GLO scheme, established just over three years ago.\nBetty's story has become a high-profile case. Mr Thomas was pressed about it on BBC's Newsnight in January, where he promised to look into her case. He met Betty and several other victims the following day.\nAlthough Betty's offer has now increased from 29% to 60% of her claim it is still far less than what she says experts told her she could expect.\nNews of her revised offer will not be encouraging for other victims also embroiled in disputes over what is full and fair redress.\nPost Office Minister Mr Thomas said he can \"understand the frustration when lawyers are not able to reach an agreement on a claim\".\n\"It is always our priority to pay as much redress as we can, and in some cases, we have been able to offer more than has been claimed,\" he said, adding that the government would take \"further steps to quickly and fairly resolve\" challenges in disputes such as Betty's.\"\nBetty is determined fight on to get what she still believes she is owed.\nChairman of the Business ad Trade Committee, Liam Byrne, said he was concerned about some victims facing a \"significant\" write-down of their claims when their initial offer is tabled.\nHe has written to Mr Thomas with a series of questions on fairness of offers, delays and transparency.\nGet in touch\nHave you been personally affected by the Post Office scandal?

        "contents": "Kara Alexander was in a cannabis-induced psychotic state, the judge said\nA mother who drowned her two young sons in the bath in what a judge described as \"the stuff of nightmares\" has been sentenced to life imprisonment.\nKara Alexander, 47, of Dagenham, was found guilty of murdering Elijah Thomas, two, and Marley Thomas, five, at their Cornwallis Road home in 2022.\nSentencing her to at least 21 years and 252 days, Mr Justice Bennathan said Alexander had been in a psychotic state after smoking cannabis and had \"unspeakably\" held them underwater for \"up to a minute or two\".\nMet Police detective Paul Waller said to the boys' family that \"no amount of time will erase the pain of such a loss but I hope this sentence serves to bring some semblance of justice\".\n'Lives snatched away'\nPost-mortem examinations concluded the boys had drowned in east London on the evening of 15 December 2022.\nSentencing Alexander, the judge said: \"You'd been smoking skunk [strong cannabis]. You'd been doing so every night for weeks, probably much longer.\n\"At some stage, both the boys were in their pyjamas ready for bed, with Elijah also wearing his nappy. You drowned them both by your deliberate acts.\"\nThe judge said there was every sign Alexander was a \"caring and affectionate\" mother to both children before the events of December 15.\nHe pointed out that their father said Alexander \"never shouted or raised her voice at the boys\" and \"never showed violence to the boys\".\nMr Justice Bennathan said Alexander was in a psychotic state when she killed her sons and that it was cannabis induced.\nMother found guilty of murdering sons aged 2 and 5\nReferring to aggravating factors in this case, Mr Justice Bennathan noted \"the vulnerability of the boys by their young age and the shocking abuse of the trust that any small child ought to be able to have in their mother or father\".\nThe judge said Alexander will mourn her sons for the rest of her life.\n\"From all that I have read and seen of you, I have no doubt that every day when you awake you will remember and grieve for the little boys whose lives you snatched away,\" he said.\n'Haunt her forever'\nThe jury previously heard how the children's father was due to look after the boys during the upcoming weekend and became concerned as Alexander had not contacted him.\nOn arrival at their home, she told him the children were upstairs sleeping, the court was told.\nBut when he went upstairs, he found the boys' bodies together in the lower bunk of their shared bunk bed dressed in pyjamas, having died several hours earlier.\nDet Ch Insp Waller said: \"This is an incredibly tragic case, which has left a father without his two beloved boys and a family without two young brothers.\n\"Kara Alexander will spend the next two decades behind bars, where the memory of what she has done will haunt her forever.\n\"I hope you can now move on with your life, remembering the boys as you knew them, and treasuring the happy times you spent with them.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

        "contents": "The number of van dwellers in Bristol has quadrupled in the last five years\nPlans to move one of the UK's biggest van-dwelling communities are under way amid growing tensions with people who live nearby.\nAt least 60 caravans and vans are parked around Durdham Down, as a rising number of people can no longer afford Bristol's rental prices. But some Clifton residents said there were problems with litter and human waste appearing at the beauty spot.\nThe rising cost of living is making the situation worse, with the number of people choosing to live in vans across the city up from 150 in 2020 to 680 in 2025.\nBristol City Council has announced proposals to create a permanent site for van-dwellers in another part of the city, which could be the first of its kind in the country.\nDave Knight moved into a van after renting a three-bed room house became unaffordable.\nDave Knight, 60, moved into an old removal van on the Downs four years ago.\nHe said: \"Work dropped off [and] I was short on money. I couldn't afford the rent on my three-bedroom house in Dursley.\"\nAnother person who decided that living in a vehicle is the best option is Jane, who said she adopted the lifestyle due to financial reasons.\n\"I've paid over \u00a3100,000 in rent and bills in my time,\" she said. \"I'm just paying someone else's mortgage.\n\"The only thing that was happening with me financially was I was getting more into debt.\"\nThis video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nWhy I live in a van on Bristol\u2019s Downs\nA builder, who wished not to be named, lives in a caravan he bought for \u00a3500.\nHe told the BBC: \"I ran out of money, I had nowhere to live. I was living in my car after they refused my application for a council home.\n\"I work, I'm always working. I build houses that I can't afford to live in.\"\nOn 26 March, so many people tried to attend a meeting on the issue that many were unable to get inside St Alban's Church in Redland.\nOrganised by the Sneyd Park Residents Association, many took the chance to voice their opposition to the city council's policy, which has so far been not to move the majority of those living in vans on the Downs.\nResident Sharon Scott said: \"[As] local residents, we're angry. We're angry that the council hasn't taken any action.\n\"The Downs was left to the people of Bristol. It's a place of natural outstanding beauty and it no longer is.\n\"As a resident I don't come to the Downs anymore. I see litter, we hear about the noise and the anti-social behaviour.\"\nFlora Sidebottom is one of a number of people who have chosen to live in vans in Bristol\nDiscussing the potential of moving, van-dweller Flora Sidebottom said she has been evicted nine times in the past year.\n\"Every eviction that I've been through causes trauma and mistrust around figures of authority and the ways in which you're going to be worked with,\" she said.\n\"It makes it harder to attend work [and] it causes negative impacts on mental and physical health and wellbeing.\n\"If you're already having to source your wood and water, suddenly you're having to think about where you're going to go next, and you're also trying to attend work and your relationships are under strain with the people around you.\n\"It feels like it's coming in from all angles.\"\nIt is thought around 60 people are now living in vans parked around The Downs\nThe council has recognised the growing need to offer alternative housing and is now looking to find a permanent site for van-dwellers.\n\"It's an example I think of the way that we're really sort of pioneering in this area,\" councillor Barry Parsons said.\n\"We're looking to find long-term solutions for an issue that's a challenge all across the country.\"\nHe added lots of people living in vans have a \"number of health vulnerabilities and mental health needs\".\nMr Parsons said that is why the council has decided to boost its outreach and support for people living in vans.\nGet in touch\nTell us which stories we should cover in Bristol\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

But the impending winds are expected to be stronger than anything the area has seen in years.\nTemperatures in Beijing are expected to drop by 13C (55F) within 24 hours, when the strongest winds hit on Saturday, authorities said.\n\"This strong wind is extreme, lasts for a long time, affects a wide area, and is highly disastrous,\" the Beijing Meteorological Service said.\nChina measures wind speed with a scale that goes from level 1 to 17. A level 11 wind, according to the China Meteorological Administration, can cause \"serious damage\", while a level 12 wind brings \"extreme destruction\".\nThe winds this weekend are expected to range from level 11 to 13.\nSeveral sporting events slated for the weekend have been suspended, including the world's first humanoid robot half marathon, which will now be held on 19 April.\nParks and tourist attractions have been closed as authorities have told residents to avoid outdoor activities, while construction works and train services have been suspended.\nThousands of trees across the city have been reinforced or pruned to prevent them from falling.\nOfficials have warned people to avoid entering mountains and forests, where gusts are expected to be especially strong.\nAs residents hunker down, social media users are finding humour in their shelved weekend plans.\n\"This wind is so sensible, it starts on Friday evening and ends on Sunday, without disrupting work on Monday at all,\" said a Weibo user.\nHashtags about the strong winds, and the warning that those weighing less than 50kg could be swept away, have been trending on Chinese social media. One Weibo user quipped: \"I eat so much all the time, just for this day.\"\nBeijing has also issued an alert for forest fires and prohibited people from starting fires outdoors.\nThe winds are expected to start weakening on Sunday night.\nRelated topics",

        "title": "Pulp unveil their first new album in 24 years",
        "contents": "BBC Radio 6 Music posted a picture of the enduring band in their current line-up\nIndie icons Pulp have announced a new album, More, and shared their first single in almost 24 years, called Spike Island.\nSpeaking on BBC 6 Music, frontman Jarvis Cocker said the band had been tempted back into the studio by the overwhelming response to their 2023 reunion tour.\n\"We did play one new song towards the end of the tour, and nobody threw things at us, or left to go to the bar,\" he said. \"So we just thought we'd carry on and see what we could conjure up.\"\nThe Sheffield band were one of the biggest acts of the 1990s Britpop era - although their music never quite fit into the backward-looking musical revisionism of that movement - with songs like Babies, Disco 2000 and Common People.\nFormed in Sheffield in 1978, they sold more than 10 million records after taking a (very) long road to success.\nAfter 2001's We Love Life, the band went on a decade-long hiatus. They reformed in 2011 for a number of festival dates, including a surprise performance Glastonbury, and reunited again in 2023.\n\nThe latest line-up of the band, along with their collaborators, were pictured in a press release announcing the new album\nThe new single was inspired by the infamous Stone Roses concert at Spike Island, Widnes, in 1990 - a show that has been variously described as a milestone for British indie music, and a disappointing shambles with dodgy sound.\nPulp guitarist Mark Webber told 6 Music's Lauren Laverne the show had been \"a slight anticlimax, to be honest\".\n\"I think everyone felt that way,\" he said. \"There was a lot of anticipation but it didn't sound very good, it was very windy and the vibe wasn't there.\"\nCocker said he hadn't been at the show, but had written the lyrics after speaking to various attendees, including musician Jason Buckle, from the band All Seeing I, who co-wrote Pulp's single.\n\"All he could remember was a DJ who between every song said, 'Spike Island come alive, Spike Island come alive',\" he said.\n\"That phrase stuck with me. I've got a very short attention span I think.\"\nCocker said the track was a sister song to 1995's Sorted for E's and Whizz, which was also based on a fan's experience of the Stone Roses' gig.\nThe inspiration for that track was \"a girl that I was speaking to at The Leadmill in Sheffield one night,\" he recalled.\n\"She said all that she could remember were people going round saying, 'Is everyone sorted for E's and whizz?'. So that phrase stuck in my mind.\"\nMore will be released on 6 June, and is dedicated to Pulp's former bassist Steve Mackey, who died in 2023, at the age of 56.\nCocker said that recording without the musician was \"weird at first\" but that there were \"two songs on the record which date from when Steve was around\", which made him feel part of the project.\n\"It was not the nicest thing,\" the singer continued, \"but people who you're close to, you never forget them, and you can do things to remember them by\".\n\nThe band have headlined the Glastonbury festival twice, but said they had \"no plans\" to return to Worthy Farm this summer\nThe album was recorded over three weeks in 2024, and Cocker said there were \"no over-riding themes, except feelings, maybe, which sounds very wafty and not very precise\".\nHe said the absence of an overarching idea had given the band a sense of freedom, compared to more conceptual Pulp albums such as This Is Hardcore.\n\"We [recorded] it quite quickly, and we were trying to not think about it too much, because that's what kind of made the last couple of Pulp albums a bit of a pain,\" he said.\n\"It was mainly my fault,\" he added, \"because I'd never got the lyrics together, so I was always changing them and messing around.\n\"This time, they were all written before we went into the studio, and I realised it was a lot less stressful.\n\"You know, I would always be a bit stressed in the studio, because I knew once the music was done, then I had to write the words. I don't know why I put myself through that,\" he said.\n\nArtificial intelligence video\nIn a press release announcing the record, Cocker added: \"We hope you enjoy the music. It was written and performed by four human beings from the North of England, aided and abetted by five other human beings from various locations in the British Isles.\n\"No AI was involved during the process.\"\nHowever, he did employ artificial intelligence to create the video for Spike Island, external, which animates the infamous \"cardboard cut-out\" figures who appear on the cover of Pulp's biggest album, Different Class.\n\nThe video riffs on the cover art for Different Class\n\"All the moving images featured in the video are the result of me feeding in a still image and then typing in a 'prompt' such as: 'The black & white figure remains still whilst the bus in the background drives off', which led to [a] sequence where the coach weirdly slides towards the cut-out of me,\" said Cocker.\n\"The weekend I began work on the video was a strange time: I went out of the house and kept expecting weird transformations of the surrounding environment due to the images the computer had been generating.\n\"The experience had marked me. I don't know whether I've recovered yet.\"\nAfter completing the video, the musician said he'd landed firmly on the side of \"human intelligence\" over AI.\nThe band will kick off a UK tour the day after the album is released in June but, in response to a 6 Music listener, said they had \"no plans\" to play Glastonbury.\nHowever, the band do have a gap in their diary for the weekend the festival takes place, before resuming their tour in Spain in July.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story said that Pulp were playing in Los Angeles on the weekend of Glastonbury. However, those dates are in September.\nRelated topics\nMore on this story\nPulp review: The mischievous Jarvis Cocker in party mode\nWhat prompted the end of Britpop?\nBritpop band Pulp to reform for 2023\nHull's Adelphi bar gets Pulp's 'piece of history'",

He has already spent almost three years in jail.\nThe defendant, whose address was given as HMP Maghaberry, was convicted on 40 counts with dates spanning seven years from 2015 to 2022.\nThe charges included multiple counts of human trafficking, supplying Class A drugs and controlling prostitution for gain.\nThe three other men - Kenneth David Harvey, aged 74; Derek Brown, aged 71; and 77-year-old Robert Albert Rogers - were previously sentenced, with Harvey and Brown jailed.\nOliver James MacCormack was convicted on 40 counts\nCourtney Smith has waived her right to anonymity to tell BBC News NI about the abuse she endured.\nShe first met MacCormack when she was 17.\nAt the time, she was going through withdrawal from heroin.\nShe said she was desperate and vulnerable.\n\"Oliver would collect me at 9pm on Bankmore Street or my hostel,\" she told BBC News NI.\n\"He would usually give me heroin and then drive me to have sex with other men. He would also have sex with me.\n\"I was scared for my life. I told him every single time that I didn't want to do this.\n\"I actually screamed 'please help me', but no one did.\"\nMs Smith said MacCormack didn't care about the physical or mental state his victims were in.\n\"I wasn't even awake half the time,\" she said.\n\"When I was awake I was in that much pain that I felt like my body wasn't my own. I just had to blank it out and pretend that I was somewhere else.\n\"I pretended I was in another place, where I was happy - that's how I got through it.\"\nMs Smith said the trauma she has been through will \"haunt her for the rest of her life\".\n\"What that man did to me, I can't put into words,\" she added.\n\"I get flashbacks, I can't sleep at night, I feel like I am right back there. A certain smell can bring me back or a taste of a food just brings me back there. I feel like I am that wee girl again in his car and this is happening to me again.\"\nCourtney Smith was one of nine women that MacCormack abused.\n'Oliver got me hooked on heroin'\nAnother one of MacCormack's victims, who wants to remain anonymous, said: \"Before meeting MacCormack, I'd only tried heroin a couple of times.\n\"Oliver got me hooked on heroin and orchestrated it that I became completely dependent on him to get my fix.\n\"One day I went from being employed in a company, aged in my early 20s, to overnight becoming an advertised escort, a heroin addict waking up sick every day; and stealing from my family to buy heroin from him.\n\"If I refused to have sex with one of the sex-buyers he had set me up with, he would not sell me any heroin and would block my phone number, leaving me sick for days.\n\"Sex with paying customers just became so normal. I would wake up every day merely existing and not living.\"\nDuring police interviews MacCormack said: \"I did help some girls who I saw on the streets in Belfast city centre who were drug addicts and homeless and whom I felt sorry for.  I helped them by giving them money.  I bought some clothes from Primark on occasion and gave them to some of the girls sometimes.\n\"I would give them a fiver or a tenner... I wouldn't want anybody's children to be in that position.\"\nBut police said MacCormack had committed a series of despicable offences against vulnerable young women.\nDet Insp Rachel Miskelly worked on the case\nSpeaking outside the court following sentencing, Det Insp Rachel Miskelly said it was a case of horrific exploitation being carried out \"by local men and on our doorsteps\".\n\"They lined their pockets at the expense of young women whilst using them for their own sexual gratification. These girls have been used, controlled and treated appallingly,\" she said.\nDet Insp Miskelly said she wanted to acknowledge the \"tremendous courage\" the victims had shown.\n\"These young women have been inspirational and I truly hope that others who are suffering are encouraged to come forward,\" the detective said.\n\"I promise you that we are here to listen to you and help you and bring those who would seek to use and abuse you to justice.\"\nPublic Prosecution Service (PPS) senior public prosecutor Kirsten McKevitt said the testimony of the victims were central to the case.\n\"As this case shows, for most people, selling sexual services is not truly a free choice,\" she said.\n\"Even when they escape their situation, many are left traumatised.\n\"Anyone paying for sexual services should know that they are contributing to the exploitation of another human being and, in many cases, the profits of human traffickers.\"\nWho are the other three men convicted?\nKenneth Harvey, Derek Brown and Robert Rodgers were also convicted\nKenneth David Harvey, 74, was handed a two-year sentence in December 2024 for trafficking a woman and paying her for sexual services.  Harvey, from Old Road in Lisburn, was told his sentence will be divided equally between prison and licence.\nDespite his initial denials, Harvey pleaded guilty to a charge of human trafficking on dates between January 1 and June 30, 2020.\nDerek Brown, 61, originally from Lisburn but now with an address listed as HMO Maghaberry was sentenced for human trafficking, controlling prostitution for gain, sexual assault, paying for sexual services and drugs related offences.\nHe exploited four \"extremely vulnerable\" young women and was given a six-year sentence in March 2025.\nHe will serve three years in jail and three on licence.\nRobert Albert Rodgers, aged 77 and from Antrim Road in Belfast, admitted one charge of brothel keeping on dates between February 9, 2009 and June 8, 2022.\nHe also admitted three counts of controlling prostitution for gain spanning a period from February 3, 2015 to September 30, 2020.\nHe was subject of a two-year Probation Order which was imposed as an alternative to immediate custody.\nDet Insp Miskelly said the four defendants were not part of an organised crime group, but \"had a despicable commonality\".\n\"They formed part of a network of older local men, who actively targeted young, vulnerable, local women for the purpose of sexual exploitation,\" she said.\nShe added that Robert Rodgers facilitated meetings between the women and sex buyers at a brothel, which he ran from his home in north Belfast.\nIf you have been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support can be found at BBC Action Line.\nRelated topics",

        "contents": "This video can not be played\nTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.\nWatch: What is a tariff? The BBC's Adam Fleming explains\nUS President Donald Trump has placed 125% tariffs on goods imported from China, leading Beijing to respond with an 84% tax on American products.\nTrump had also brought high tariffs on dozens of other countries but these have been suspended for 90 days.\nHe argues that tariffs will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs, but the world economy has been thrown into chaos and prices are expected to rise for consumers.\nWhat are tariffs and how do they work?\nTariffs are taxes charged on goods bought from other countries.\nTypically, they are a percentage of a product's value. The 125% tariff on Chinese goods means that a $10 product would attract a $12.50 tax on top - raising the total cost to $22.50.\nThe companies that bring the foreign goods into the country have to pay the tax to the government.\nThe money is collected when the imported goods clear US customs.\nFirms can choose to pass on some or all of the increased cost to customers.\nFollow live: Global markets rebound after Trump reversal\nTrump steps back from cliff edge of global trade war\nWhy is Trump using tariffs?\nFor decades, Trump has argued the US should use tariffs to boost its economy.\nHe says they will encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised and lead to huge levels of investment in the country.\nTrump wants to reduce the gap between the value of goods the US buys from other countries and the value of those it sells to them. He argues that America has been taken advantage of by \"cheaters\" and \"pillaged\" by foreigners.\nThe US president has also made other demands alongside tariffs. The first announced during his current term targeted China, Mexico and Canada, after he said he wanted them to do more to stop migrants and illegal drugs reaching the US.\nTrump has strongly defended his tariff policy but influential voices within his Republican Party have joined opposition Democrats and foreign leaders in attacking the measures.\nTrump steps back: Retreat or negotiating strategy?\n'Sometimes you have to take medicine': Trump defends sweeping tariffs\nIs the US making $2bn a day from tariffs? Trump claims fact-checked\nWhat has Trump announced on tariffs?\nSince Trump's inauguration in January there has been a flurry of announcements on tariffs, with other countries scrambling to respond.\n1 February: The president announces a 25% levy on Canadian and Mexican exports to the US - and an additional 10% on China\n3 February: Mexico and Canada reach a deal to pause US tariffs for one month\n10 February: Trump announces a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US\n4 March: The White House increases the tariff on Chinese imports to 20%\n5 March: Trump temporarily exempts carmakers from the 25% tax imposed on Canada and Mexico\n7 March: Trump expands the range of goods exempted from the Canada and Mexico tariffs\n12 March: The 25% steel and aluminium tariffs take effect\n26 March: The White House announces 25% duties on cars will apply from 2 April and on car parts at a later date but before 3 May\n2 April: Trump says the US will impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on certain countries, as well as a universal 10% levy on imports from all other countries, including the UK\n5 April: The 10% tariffs take effect\n9 April: Tariffs on roughly 60 countries - described by the US president as the \"worst offenders\" - are introduced. Trump then announces a 90-day pause for all countries, except China. The \"baseline\" 10% rate applies everywhere but China which faces 125% tariffs\n10 April: China's retaliatory 84% levy on US goods takes effect. The EU says it will pause its planned US tariffs for 90 days\nThe current exemption for goods in small parcels sent from China worth less than $800 (\u00a3624) ends on 2 May. These will have a duty rate of 90% or $75 per item - increasing to $150 per item after 1 June.\nThe \"baseline\" 10% rate does not apply to Canada and Mexico. There have been a number of exemptions and delays since Trump announced they would face tariffs of 25% on most goods and 10% on Canadian energy.\nBBC Verify: How were Donald Trump's tariffs calculated?\nHow much trade is there between the US and China?\nThe US currently runs a trade deficit with China. In 2024, the US imported far more from China ($440bn) than Beijing imported from America ($145bn).\nIn his first term as president, Trump imposed significant tariffs on China, which were retained and expanded by his successor Joe Biden.\nTogether those trade barriers helped to reduce the amount the US bought from China from 21% of America's total imports in 2016 to 13% in 2024.\nHowever, China still ships everything from iPhones to children's toys to the US. Analysts have pointed out that some Chinese goods enter the US via other south-east Asian countries, which could mean they can avoid the 125% rate.\nWhy Trump is hitting China on trade - and what might happen next\nWhat would a US-China trade war do to the world economy?\nWill prices go up for US consumers?\nMany economists expect tariffs to push up prices across a range of imported goods, as firms pass on some or all of their increased costs.\nThe products affected could include everything from clothing to coffee and alcohol to electronics.\nSome firms may also decide to import fewer foreign goods, which could make those which are available more expensive.\nThe price of goods manufactured in the US using imported components may also rise.\nFor example, car parts typically cross the US, Mexican and Canadian borders multiple times before a vehicle is completely assembled.\nCar prices had already been expected to increase as a result of earlier tariffs, which remain in place.\nThe cost of a car made using parts from Mexico and Canada alone could rise by $4,000-$10,000 (\u00a33,035 - \u00a37,588) depending on the vehicle, according to analysts at the Anderson Economic Group.\nWhat has happened to stock markets?\nTrump's tariffs announcements have caused significant volatility on global stock markets.\nStock markets are where firms sell shares in their business. They reflect the best guess of what every company in the world is worth and what their future profits will be.\nMany people are affected by stock market price falls - even if they don't invest in shares directly - because of the knock-on effect on pensions, jobs and interest rates.\nShare prices dropped sharply after the global tariffs were announce because investors thought they would increase costs and reduce profits. But after Trump announced the 90-day pause, US, Asian and European markets rebounded sharply.\nHow does it affect me if share prices fall?\nStocks, tariffs and pensions - your questions answered\nHow will Trump's tariffs affect the UK?\nThe UK exported around \u00a358bn of goods to the US in 2024, external, mainly cars, machinery and pharmaceuticals.\nIt was already due to be affected by the earlier tariffs targeting steel, aluminium and car imports.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said \"clearly there will be an economic impact\" from the 10% tariff. However, he said US-UK trade talks are ongoing, and that he will \"fight for the best deal for Britain\".\nThe UK government has so far not announced any taxes on US imports. However, it is drawing up a list of US products it could hit with retaliatory tariffs.\nFollowing the announcement of tariffs, car maker Jaguar Land Rover said it would \"pause\" all shipments to the US as it worked to \"address the new trading terms\".\nEconomists have warned US tariffs could knock the UK's economy off course and make it harder for the government to hit its borrowing rules.\nHow PM might tackle impact of Trump tariffs\nHow exposed is the UK to Trump's tariff chaos?\nHow have other countries responded to Trump's decision to pause the tariffs?\nFor countries on Donald Trump's so-called \"worst offenders\" list, there was a sigh of relief when tariffs were downgraded to 10%.\nEU The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Trump's decision was an \"important step towards stabilising the global economy\" and said the EU would pause its own retaliatory tariffs for 90 days.\nPoland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk urged all parties to \"make the best\" of the 90 day pause, stressing that maintaining strong relations with the US \"is a common responsibility of Europeans and Americans\"\nVietnam's Deputy PM Ho Duc Phoc said that the US and Vietnam expect to start \"negotiations on a bilateral trade agreement\" which \"would include tariff agreements\"\nGermany's incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the pause proves a united European approach to trade has a positive effect, adding: \"Europeans are determined to defend ourselves\"\nCanada, which has been targeted by tariffs above 10%, introduced a 25% tariff on some vehicles from the US on 9 April.\nSee the Trump tariffs list by country\nRelated topics",

        "contents": "A cultural tour of Greenland by JD Vance's wife Usha has been cancelled\nA green shimmer, like a curtain of light being drawn across the night sky, formed beside the impossibly bright stars above Nuuk late on Friday evening.\nThe appearance of the spectacular northern lights \u2013 a common wonder in these parts \u2013 seemed to mark the end of a hugely significant day in the arctic, one that brought icebound Greenland's hopes and challenges into the sharpest relief.\nIt was a day in which an acquisitive foreign power had sent an uninvited delegation to the world's largest island with an uncomfortable message.\nOn a brief visit to a remote US military base in the far north of Greenland, US Vice-President JD Vance may have tried at times to soften his boss's stated aim of simply annexing the autonomous Danish territory.\n\"We do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary,\" Vance said, perhaps attempting to sound reassuring.\nBut the vice-president's overarching message remained stark and intimidating: the world, the climate, and the Arctic region are changing fast, and Greenland needs to wake up to threats posed by an expansionist China; long-standing Western security partnerships have run their course; the only way the island can protect itself, its values and its mineral wealth is by abandoning weak and miserly Danish overlords and turning instead to the muscular and protective embrace of the US.\nRos Atkins on... Trump's plan for Greenland\nGreenlanders prepare for uncomfortable visit from US vice-president\nGreenland's opposition wins election dominated by independence and Trump\n\"We need to wake up from a failed, 40-year consensus that said that we could ignore the encroachment of powerful countries as they expand their ambitions,\" Vance told US troops at America's Pituffik military base.\n\"We can't just bury our head in the sand - or, in Greenland, bury our head in the snow - and pretend that the Chinese are not interested in this very large landmass.\"\nIf you look at a map of the world that has the north pole at its centre, rather than the equator, it is easy to see how Greenland suddenly switches from being an easily overlooked smudge of uninhabited territory and into a key strategic landmass. It is at the heart of what many analysts now accept as an emerging power struggle between China, the US, and Russia, for control of the arctic, its minerals and its shipping lanes.\nBut the speed and contempt with which the Trump White House has rejected its traditional reliance on Western allies \u2013 Nato in particular \u2013 has left its partners bewildered.\n\"Not justifiable,\" was the bristling response of Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen after hearing Vance attack her government as he stood on its sovereign territory.\n'Like a threat'\nBut 1,500km (930 miles) south of the Pituffik base, in Greenland's capital, Nuuk, the American story vied for attention with a very different local event on Friday.\n\"We will prevail,\" a smiling crowd sang, at a ceremony to celebrate the formation of a new coalition government for Greenland.\nThe mood felt mostly joyful and communal, with people locking arms and swaying gently as a band played inside the town's house of culture.\nIt was a powerful reminder of the shared values that bind Greenland's tiny, and overwhelmingly native Inuit population together - the need for consensus and co-operation in an often hostile natural climate, the desire to protect and celebrate Inuit culture and the wish to be respected by outsiders, be they from familiar but distant Denmark or marginally closer America.\n\"There are many ways to say things. But I think the way [Trump] is saying it is not the way. It's like a threat,\" said Lisbeth Karline Poulsen, 43, a local artist attending the ceremony.\nHer reaction appeared to capture the broader mood here - a recent poll showed just 6% of the population support the idea of being part of the US.\nThe journey to independence\nUnder its new government, and with overwhelming public support, Greenland is beginning a slow, very cautious move towards full independence from Denmark.\nIt's a process that will likely take many years, and which will involve lengthy dialogue with both Copenhagen and Washington.\nAfter all, Greenlanders well understand that their economy needs to be far more developed if their bid for independence is to stand any realistic chance of success.\nBut they need to balance that development against realistic fears of exploitation by powerful outside commercial forces.\nWhich brings us to the fundamental confusion, in Greenland and beyond, about the Trump administration's approach towards their territory.\nIs Greenland For Sale?\nUS president Donald Trump says he wants the US to take over Greenland. Many people think it will never happen. But could it? If so, how?\nWhat does America want?\nOn his visit, Vance mentioned Greenland's aspirations for independence, and implied that America's real intention was not a sudden annexation of the island, but something far more patient and long-term.\n\"Our message is very simple, yes, the people of Greenland are going to have self-determination. We hope that they choose to partner with the United States, because we're the only nation on earth that will respect their sovereignty and respect their security.\"\nIf that is genuinely the American pitch \u2013 Trump's messaging remains more aggressive than Vance's \u2013 then Greenlanders can surely relax a little and take their time.\nThere are still large reserves of goodwill towards the US here, and a keen interest in doing more business with American companies.\nOn the security front, a 74-year-old treaty with Denmark permitting the US to increase its military presence in Greenland at any time \u2013 from new bases to submarine harbours - should surely take care of Washington's concerns about countering the threat from China, just as it did during the Cold War years.\nWhat remains puzzling is Donald Trump's impatience \u2013 the same impatience he's displayed in attempting to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.\nShort of owning Greenland, America could get everything it desires and needs from this vast island without much difficulty. Instead, many people in Nuuk feel they're being bullied.\nIt's a deeply counterproductive approach, which has already forced Washington into one humiliating climbdown \u2013 cancelling a planned cultural tour by Vance's wife, Usha, to Nuuk and another town in the face of planned local protests.\nA slower, more respectful, behind-the-scenes sort of engagement would, surely, make more sense.\nBut that's not to every politician's taste.\nRelated topics\nMore on this story\nWhy does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?\nRosenberg: Putin nods to Trump plans to seize Greenland\nJD Vance will join wife in Greenland but trip scaled back",

Denmark's territory, when we are met by pressure and by threats from our closest ally, what are we to believe in, about the country that we have admired for so many years?\"\nFrederiksen rode around the capital Nuuk in a Danish navy patrol boat, alongside Egede and Nielsen.\nAccording to Danish public broadcaster DR, many people cheered at seeing the Danish prime minister, with one resident shouting from a window: \"Hey Mette!

About 56,000 people live there, mostly indigenous Inuit people.\nAbout 80% of its territory is covered by ice, meaning most people live on the south-western coast around the capital, Nuuk.\nAn autonomous - or self-governing - territory of Denmark, it is also home to Danish and US military bases.\nGreenland's economy is mainly based on fishing. Large subsidies from the Danish government account for about a fifth of its income, or GDP.\nIn recent years, there has been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources, including mining for rare earth minerals, uranium and iron.\nThese may become more accessible as global warming leads to some of the ice covering Greenland to melt.\nInside the race for Greenland's mineral wealth\nIs Greenland for Sale?\nUS president Donald Trump says he wants the US to take over Greenland. Many people think it will never happen. But could it? If so, how?\nWhat is Greenland's status?\nLocated geographically within North America, Greenland has been controlled by Denmark \u2013 nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away \u2013 for about 300 years.\nThe island was governed as a colony until the mid-20th Century. For much of this time, it remained isolated and poor.\nIn 1953, it was made part of the Kingdom of Denmark and Greenlanders became Danish citizens.\nIn 1979, a referendum on home rule gave Greenland control of most policies within the territory, with Denmark retaining control over foreign affairs and defence.\nWhy does Greenland matter to the US?\nThe US has long maintained a security interest in Greenland. After Nazi Germany occupied mainland Denmark during World War Two, the US invaded Greenland, establishing military and radio stations across the territory.\nAfter the war, US forces remained in Greenland. Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, has been operated by the US ever since.\nIn 1951, a defence agreement with Denmark granted the US a significant role in the defence of the territory, including the right to build and maintain military bases.\n\"If Russia were to send missiles towards the US, the shortest route for nuclear weapons would be via the North Pole and Greenland,\" said Marc Jacobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College.\n\"That's why the Pituffik Space Base is immensely important in defending the US.\"\nChina and Russia have begun building up their Arctic military capabilities in recent years, according to an Arctic Institute paper. The paper called for the US to further develop its presence in the Arctic to counter its rivals.\nIn January, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Denmark was open to discussions with the US, adding that Washington had \"legitimate\" interests in the region.\n\"We see a Russia that is arming itself. We see a China that is also starting to take an interest,\" Rasmussen said.\nTrump is also likely interested in the mining potential across Greenland's vast landmass, Mr Jacobsen added, especially the rare earth minerals in the south.\nDanes struggle with response to Trump Greenland threat\nDoes the US want full control of Greenland?\nDuring a speech to Congress, Trump said that control of Greenland was essential \"for national security and international security.\"\nHe said he strongly supported the people of Greenland's right to determine their own future.\n\"If you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America,\" he added.\nPresident Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr, visited Greenland in January, weeks before the presidential inauguration\nThough the president's rhetoric may seem unusual, a succession of US presidents have tried to gain control of Greenland for more than a century.\n\"The US has tried a few times to push the Danes out of Greenland and take it over as part of the US, or at least to have full security tutelage of Greenland,\" said Lukas Wahden, the author of 66\u00b0 North, external, a newsletter on Arctic security.\nIn 1867, after buying Alaska from Russia, US Secretary of State William H Seward led negotiations to buy Greenland from Denmark, but failed to reach any agreement.\nIn 1946, the US offered to pay $100m (equivalent to $1.2bn; \u00a3970m today) for the territory, judging that it was vital for national security, but the Danish government refused.\nTrump also tried to buy Greenland during his first presidential term.\nBoth Denmark and the Greenlandic government rejected the 2019 proposal, saying: \"Greenland is not for sale.\"\nPituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, has been operated by the US since World War Two\nWhat do the people of Greenland think?\nThe debate over the territory's independence has been \"put on steroids by Trump\", according to Masaana Egede, editor of the newspaper Sermitsiaq.\nAccording to recent polls, almost 80% of Greenlanders back independence from Denmark.\nBut an opinion survey in January, external found that 85% of Greenlanders rejected the idea of becoming part of the US, versus 6% who wanted it. The rest were undecided.\nWhen BBC correspondent Fergal Keane visited the island in January, he said he heard one phrase again and again: \"Greenland belongs to Greenlanders. So, Trump can visit but that's it.\"\nThe issue took centre stage in the election.\nMembers of the IA Party (Inuit Ataqatigiit) wave red and white Greenland flags on election day\n\"We deserve to be treated with respect and I don't think the American president has done that lately since he took office,\" said outgoing Prime Minister Egede during the campaign.\nHe previously said the territory should free itself from \"the shackles of colonialism\", but wanted to take gradual steps towards autonomy.\nIn contrast, the opposition party Naleraq wanted to immediately start divorce proceedings from Denmark and have closer defence dealings with Washington.\nSpeaking after the election results, the man expected to become the nect PM - Democratic leader Jens-Frederik Nielsen - said that \"Greenland needs us to stand together in a time of great interest from outside.\"\nWhen Trump first raised the idea of buying Greenland in 2019, many locals told the BBC they were opposed to the proposal.\n\"This is a very dangerous idea,\" said Dines Mikaelsen, a tour operator who was born and raised in Tasiilaq, east Greenland.\n\"He's treating us like a good he can purchase,\" said Aleqa Hammond, Greenland's first female prime minister.\nRelated topics",

        "contents": "The team advised forces not to confirm or deny if they used a facial recognition site\nA national policing unit has been criticised for telling local forces to block the release of information under laws designed to safeguard the public's right to know.\nThe National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) has advised forces not to reveal information on topics including the use of banned surveillance software and the spread of super-strength drugs, the BBC has found.\nCampaign group Big Brother Watch said the NPCC team \u2013 known as the central referral unit (CRU) \u2013 was acting like an \"authoritarian censor\" rather than a public body.\nThe CRU said it acted in line with legislation and only recommended how local forces should respond to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests.\nThe BBC was alerted to the unit's involvement in local forces' FOI responses while researching the spread of potent synthetic opioids.\nSixteen forces - more than a third of the UK's total number - had given us details about crimes linked with the drugs, but then retracted their responses at the unit's request.\nThe unit argued the information would undermine national security as it could be exploited by drug traffickers.\nOur subsequent investigation found the CRU had advised local forces on 1,706 occasions in the first three months of 2024 - equivalent to one in every 11 requests submitted to forces in that time.\nOn another occasion, it cited concerns about \"negative press\", external when advising forces to retract earlier responses and instead neither confirm nor deny if their officers had used the facial recognition search engine PimEyes, according to documents obtained by Liberty Investigates.\nThe software has been banned by Scotland Yard, external.\nBig Brother Watch's Jake Hurfurt said the CRU's work was \"alarming\"\nJake Hurfurt, the head of research and investigations at Big Brother Watch, said pressurising police forces to retract data was \"the practice of an authoritarian censor not an accountable public body\".\n\"It is alarming that the NPCC is going beyond giving advice to individual forces and instead seemingly orchestrating how every force responds to sensitive transparency requests,\" he said.\nThe CRU said it was legitimately discussing \"negative press\" or \"media attention\" when researching what information was already published, but those factors did not influence whether it favoured disclosure.\nIt also said it had had a smaller volume of work in each year since 2020.\nWhat is Freedom of Information?\nFOI laws came into force in the UK in January 2005 and allow anyone to apply to government or public bodies to see information, such as crime statistics or details on expenditure.\nUsing those laws, citizens can ask for information from people in power - sometimes including details they might prefer had stayed a secret.\nThe Freedom of Information Act presumes each request should lead to information being disclosed, unless a legal exemption applies.\nOur investigation revealed the CRU did not follow the so-called \"applicant-blind principle\" when responding to FOI requests.\nThe principle states everyone should get the same level and quality of response, regardless of whether it is their first request or they use the act regularly in their work.\nThe CRU, however, recorded whether requesters were members of the media and their organisation.\nIt said it was not subject to the applicant-blind principle because it was only an advisor, but would stop the practice from March 2025.\nIt also said it could not share records of when it had conducted public interest tests or if and when it had favoured the disclosure of information that was in the spirit of FOI laws, external.\nLiberty director Akiko Hart said FOI requests provided a \"route to justice\"\nAkiko Hart, director of human rights advocacy group Liberty, said: \"It's incredibly concerning that police have continually tried to downplay, hide and rescind information that is in the public interest.\n\"At a time when public trust in police is at an all-time low, transparency in their actions has never been more important. The police have a statutory duty to provide information held by them when requested by the public and journalists, and must not try to circumvent this.\"\nIn 2022, an independent review was conducted into a separate government unit that advised other departments on their FOI responses. The review found poor practice and recommended the unit's replacement, external.\nThe so-called Clearing House was part of the Cabinet Office. It was alleged to have profiled journalists and treated their FOI requests inappropriately.\nThe review rejected its approach of circulating the names of requesters who had asked the same questions of several departments \u2013 a so-called round robin requester \u2013 to help it coordinate similar responses.\nThe government's response was to say it would pilot a new system \"immediately\", but the BBC found the NPCC's CRU still matched names to round robin requests 18 months after the Clearing House recommendations were published.\nFOI requests led to the exposure in 2009 of the MPs' expenses scandal, symbolised by Sir Peter Viggers' failed attempt to claim \u00a31,645 for a floating duck house in the pond at his constituency home\nClaire Miller, former data journalism editor and an expert in FOI, said further investigation was needed as the CRU did not seem to be \"operating within the spirit of the FOI Act.\"\n\"It does not seem to have taken on board the criticisms of and recommendations for the Clearing House, which perhaps it should have done,\" she said.\nThe NPCC declined to give an interview but instead issued a statement.\nChief Constable Rob Carden, its digital, data and technology lead, said: \"Policing is firmly committed to being open and transparent. Compliance with the Freedom of Information Act 2000 is one important way we remain accountable to the public.\n\"We always strive to share as much as we can in our responses with a presumption to disclose.  However, there are circumstances where information cannot be disclosed and needs to be redacted, and on occasions withheld, to ensure police can continue to use tactics to protect the public or to prevent sensitive information being exploited by criminals to cause harm.  These instances are strictly sanctioned with clear parameters, as set out in legislation.\"\nHe said complaints about how forces applied the FOI Act could be referred to the Information Commisioner's Office (ICO).\nA spokeperson for the ICO said the data watchdog had used its powers \"proactively numerous times\" in the last two years to ensure police forces were compliant.\nThey said: \"We will continue to take action when necessary, including keeping under review whether any central co-ordination in this sector is having a negative impact on compliance with the law when we examine the complaints that come to us.\"\nMartin Rosenbaum said the ICO had found more than one in three forces were failing to meet FOI requirements since 2020\nAuthor Martin Rosenbaum, a former FOI lead for the BBC, said the performance of police forces when it came to handling FOI requests had \"seriously deteriorated\".\n\"The ICO has taken enforcement action against 15 police forces because of their FOI failings, which is more than one in three forces nationally, and is the worst record of any part of the public sector,\" he said.\nSurrey and South Yorkshire police were among the forces issued with enforcement notices in 2024 for failing to answer requests within the 20 days set out by law.\nThe ICO spokesperson said there was nothing to stop public bodies like the police seeking advice from a central body on how to correctly interpret the law, but it must not stop them meeting deadlines for responses or any other FOI requirements.\nAdditional data journalism: Paul Bradshaw\nMore about this story\nThe Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.\nRead more about the Local News Partnerships here.\nRelated topics\nRelated stories\nSurrey Police told to act over outstanding FOIs\nPolice force's FOI responses 'woeful' - watchdog\nStalking fears over facial search engine\nNewspapers concerned over government's FOI process\nRelated internet links\nInformation Commissioner's Office\nNational Police Chiefs' Council",

        "contents": "Anne Jacques said the death of her son Alex had been like losing \"half of herself\"\nSuper-strength drugs linked to hundreds of deaths have been found in samples of fake medicines bought across the UK, the BBC can reveal.\nWe found more than 100 examples of people trying to buy prescription medicines such as diazepam - commonly used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms and seizures - and instead receiving products containing nitazenes.\nThe synthetic opioid drugs have been connected to 278 deaths across the country in a year, according to the National Crime Agency (NCA). Nitazenes can be stronger than both heroin and fentanyl, a prolific killer in the US.\nMartin Raithelhuber, an illicit synthetic drug expert from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, said the BBC\u2019s findings were a \u201cvery worrying development\u201d.\nWarning: This article contains descriptions of drugs use\nA government spokesperson said it was \u201csecuring our borders from the threat\u201d through \u201cworld-leading intelligence, dedicated cross-government taskforce and extensive international networks\u201d.\nThe contaminated substances were identified in anonymous samples submitted to WEDINOS, the only national drug-checking service in the UK.\nIt said the fake medicines looked like \"the same kind of packet you might get from your chemist on the high street\" but were \"most likely purchased from illicit online pharmacies\".\nAnne Jacques had never heard of nitazenes when a police officer knocked at her door in the early hours of 17 July 2023 and said her son had been found dead at his student flat.\nAlex Harpum, 23, had been preparing for a career as an opera singer and had been accepted for a two-year masters course.\n\u201cWatching him sing was one of the biggest joys in my life ever,\u201d Ms Jacques said.\nAnne Jacques (right) said singing had \"changed the life\" of her son Alex Harpum (left)\nIt was initially suspected the cause of his death was sudden adult death syndrome, but eight months later Alex's family learned he had taken a substance contaminated with a nitazene.\nPhone records suggested he had tried to buy tablets usually sold as Xanax, which are only available with a private prescription in the UK.\nMs Jacques, who lives in north Wales, believes Alex was doing so because he often struggled with sleeping while taking medication for his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\nThe traces of nitazenes were only detected after she queried with police why earlier tests had not looked for them.\nMs Jacques said she remained in \u201cdisbelief\" at the lack of testing, adding: \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t pushed for better answers in the middle of massive grief, then to this day I would have no idea how he actually died.\n\"Unless we\u2019re testing for them, how is anyone going to be aware and informed [of the dangers]?\"\nA Scotland Yard spokesperson said there had been \u201cdelays beyond the control of the Met\u201d relating to the need for, and timing of, specialist testing in this case.\nThe North London Coroner Service said it remained in contact with the family regarding their concerns.\nScotland Yard said its thoughts remained with Alex Harpum's family and friends\nThe BBC analysed sample results published by WEDINOS, a Public Health Wales service which shares information about the UK's illegal drugs market. It records what the person submitting each sample said they had intended to buy.\nIn the year to September 2024, there were 130 instances of someone trying to buy medicines illegally to possess without a prescription, and instead receiving substances contaminated with nitazenes.\nMany were purporting to be benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, and insomnia treatments including temazepam and zolpidem.\nNitazenes were also found in substances masquerading as promethazine, an allergy medication.\nProfessor Rick Lines, from WEDINOS, said: \u201cPerhaps people have found that they weren't able to continue on a legitimate prescription and decided to go through what they think is an alternative legitimate route, but is in fact not.\u201d\nThe government plans to make all types of nitazenes Class A drugs. Fifteen synthetic opioids were reclassified in March.\nUnder the Misuse of Drugs Act, those caught in their supply and production could face up to life in prison while those in possession could face up to seven years.\nMartin Raithelhuber said nitazenes had been found in 29 countries\nMr Raithelhuber said there was a \"lesson to learn... from North America\", where people became addicted to prescription painkillers before the use of fake medicines containing fentanyl became widespread.\n\u201cSo here in Europe, we are not yet in that situation, but this could be the early signs of traffickers trying to expand,\" he said.\n\u201cI think it's a warning call, maybe for all other countries in Europe\u2026 that nitazenes are probably here to stay for the time being, and that their potential negative impact on the health of users is huge.\u201d\nHe said because both benzodiazepines and nitazenes were depressants, \u201ctheir combined effect increases the risk of overdose significantly\u201d.\nSynthetic opioid effects\nSigns that someone may have taken one of these drugs:\nSmall, narrowed pupils\nReduced or loss of consciousness\nDizziness or drowsiness\nDifficulty breathing\nNausea or vomiting\nCold or clammy skin\nBlue or grey lips and fingernails\nLow blood pressure or decreased heart rate\nAnyone who has consumed synthetic opioids and experiences the symptoms described should seek urgent medical treatment.\nSource: Metropolitan Police\nThe groups of people most at risk were \u201cthose who have always been at the highest risk of all drug-related harm,\u201d said Harry Sumnall, a professor in substance use at Liverpool John Moores University.\nHe said this included people with drug use problems and those \u201cusing drugs to help manage their life circumstances\u201d.\nProf Harry Sumnall was a government adviser on misuse of drugs from 2011-2019\nThe NCA believes nitazenes are being produced in Chinese labs and brought into the UK through the Royal Mail and other parcel operators.\nDark web marketplaces seen by the BBC suggest some of the same online sellers in China are advertising nitazenes in bulk as well as adulterated benzodiazepines.\nThe Border Force only examines post for drugs if there is a known risk or intelligence. It says dogs trained to detect nitazenes and other synthetic opioids are \u201cdue to enter service shortly\u201d.\nIts teams seized new synthetic opioids nine times in the past financial year, according to a response under the Freedom of Information Act.\nThose seizures ranged in size from 1g to 1.32kg, which experts said could equate to tens of thousands of doses.\nUK too slow to act on lethal drug threat - doctors\nDrug dealers offer BBC team deadly opioids\nDrugs stronger than heroin linked to 54 UK deaths\nThe government said it would also test for the presence of the new drugs in wastewater from sewage treatment plants to anticipate the threat of a spike in overdoses.\nIt has, however, admitted such testing is currently \"experimental\". The process took around two months at the only laboratory known to have successfully confirmed samples, external.\nExperts previously told the BBC the last government had been too slow to recognise the scale of the problem.\nNCA deputy director Charles Yates said it took the threat from nitazenes \u201cseriously\u201d and was taking a \u201czero-tolerance approach\u201d.\nThere are an average of 49 drug poisoning deaths weekly involving opiates - such as heroin, oxycodone, fentanyl and including synthetic opioids - across England and Wales, the latest official figures, external suggest.\nAdditional data journalism: Paul Bradshaw\nIf you have been affected by the issues raised in this story help and support is available via the BBC Action Line.\nMore about this story\nThe Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.\nRead more about the Local News Partnerships here.\nRelated topics",

like family centres and youth projects - played a vital role in ensuring challenges were addressed before they could escalate.\nShe said: \"Whilst scaling back children\u2019s services might seem like a way to balance budgets, it ultimately has a lifetime cost for a generation of children.\"\nPeter Evans is head of Ysgol Bro Banw primary school in Wales\nPeter Evans, from Carmarthenshire, has been a headteacher for 22 years and said the situation facing schools was \"the worst it has ever been\".\nHe said cuts and changes to non-statutory early intervention services were having a significant impact, with his school having to spend more on nappies, wipes and changing tables.\n\"We are in a perfect storm with our money going down and need going up, with more children coming in non-verbal and not toilet trained and access to services like speech and language, educational psychologists and occupational therapy under threat,\" Mr Evans said.\n\"Councils are in a difficult position, but children get one chance and children are the future.\"\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said the BBC's findings \"lay bare the tough reality many schools and families are facing\" as a result of council-funded education budgets being slashed.\nHe warned the situation could eventually undermine the education system's ability to support children.\n'Limiting lives'\nCampaigners say the budgetary crisis in local government is also limiting the lives of millions of disabled people.\nMikey Erhardt, from Disability Rights UK, said many were being plunged into \"hardship, isolation, distress and deepening poverty\" as a result.\nHe said the situation was also affecting the life chances of disabled children, who faced a constant battle for support.\n\"The underfunding of social care in particular goes far beyond the numbers on a Whitehall spreadsheet - it goes to the very core of how we value the lives of disabled citizens,\" he said.\n\"Millions of us, young and old,  are going without the care and support we need.\"\nHe added when care and support was provided, it was often just the basics rather than the support needed to life a full life and engage with others.\nVickki Byrne says more trained classroom support for children with special educational needs is urgently needed\nFormer teaching assistant Vickki Byrne has seen the impact of classroom budget cuts and reduced council services as both a professional and a parent.\n\"I've seen children with Education and Health Care Plans, who are supposed to receive one-on-one support, have their teaching assistant dragged away to help with the rest of the class,\" she said.\n\"These children want to work and do well but they are in an environment that isn\u2019t supporting them.\"\nMs Byrne said she had seen pupils in their final years of secondary school who could \"barely read and write\" and had had to \"fight tooth and nail\" to get support for her own child.\nShe said her daughter, who struggled to cope in her mainstream school, had suffered as a result of significant delays to support from social workers and other local authority services.\n\"There's no safety net now and it's an absolute nightmare,\" she said. \"I've had to give up my job and become a full-time carer for my daughter and I've even had to call crisis services for myself because I became suicidal after not being able to get the help for her.\"\n'Scrabbling around'\nThe BBC\u2019s analysis also uncovered examples of councils approving the removal of  flagpoles, cutting long service awards for staff, removing coastal lifeguards, ending asbestos collection from households and introducing dynamic theatre pricing so tickets cost more as demand rises.\nDr Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of the Local Government Information Unit (LGiU), said it proved local authorities were \u201cscrabbling about\u201d and putting forward \u201calmost comical\u201d proposals in a desperate attempt to safeguard vital services.\nLGA chairwoman Louise Gittins warned the risk of financial failure across local government was \u201cbecoming systemic\u201d.\nShe joined the LGiU in calling on the new Labour government to provide councils with financial stability and funding reform, including the introduction of multi-year funding settlements.\nLocal government minister Jim McMahon said it would take time to \"get ahead of the underlying pressures for the benefit of councils and local communities\"\nCouncils are funded through a mix of council tax, business rates, income from services like parking and social housing rent, as well as money from the government known as the Revenue Support Grant.\nThat funding declined by nearly a third between 2010 and 2021, according to the Public Accounts Committee, which found council income was \u00a38.4bn lower in real terms than the decade before.\nMcMahon said these \"deep-rooted\" problems could not be fixed overnight, adding the government was committed to \"reforming and rebuilding\" the sector.\nThe minister said: \"We will work hand-in-hand with councils by moving towards multi-year funding settlements to provide long-term stability, ending competitive bidding processes, and ensure the sector gets back on its feet.\u201d\nMore about this story\nThe Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.\nRead more about the Local News Partnerships here.\nRelated topics\nMore stories from the BBC\nBlack hole in town hall budgets rises to \u00a35bn\nFixing finances harder than expected -

        "title": "What does Trump's tariff pause mean for global trade?",
        "contents": "There has been a historic upheaval in American trade policy.\nThe announcement of Donald Trump's so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on 2 April - what he called \"liberation day\" - sent a shockwave through the global trading system and financial markets.\nAnd the President's 90-day pause on some of these tariffs on 9 April set off a relief rally in stock markets.\nBut where has the rollercoaster of new US tariff announcements - and partial reversals - actually left the situation?\nAnd what will it all mean for global trade?\nWhat does the pause mean?\nThe announced pause only applies to some of the new tariffs - taxes on imports - that Donald Trump announced on 2 April.\nThe new minimum 10% tariff rate, which came into effect on Saturday 5 April, is still in place for goods coming from all countries, including the UK.\nThere are exemptions for pharmaceuticals and microchips and some other items.\nBut that 10% tariff in itself is a major change in America's trading relations with all other countries.\nAnd for China, the rate will not fall at all but will be hiked further to 125%, plus another 20% linked to the drug fentanyl.\nNevertheless, the pause means the rates above 10% for 59 other territories will be suspended until July.\nThat includes 46% on Vietnam, 44% on Sri Lanka and 20% on the European Union.\n\nThat's something of a relief for these nations, especially developing countries that rely heavily on manufactured goods exports to America.\nExports to the US are equivalent to 30% of Vietnam's economy and there were fears a 46% tariff would have plunged the South East Asian nation into recession.\nBut Vietnam and others will still be paying the new 10% minimum tariff rate when previously many were facing substantially lower levies.\nAnd countries such as Australia, external and South Korea, which had free trade deals, external with Washington - meaning zero tariffs on many exports to the US  - will still see a major break in their trading relationships with America. They too will be subject to the 10% tariff.\nThe president has unilaterally torn up those free trade deals - as well as the one America had with Canada and Mexico, which Trump signed in his first term.\nWhat about Trump's other tariffs?\nNumerous other tariffs Trump has announced since returning to the White House remain in place and are not affected by the pause.\nThat includes:\n25% tariffs on all car imports to America, including from the UK\n25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, including products made from these metals\n25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and Canada.\nIn big picture terms, economists warn the extent to which the pause actually changes the direction of overall US trade policy should not be exaggerated.\nBloomberg Economics, external has calculated the US's average tariff on all its imports was set to go to 27% before the pause, the highest in more than 100 years.\nAnd after the pause they estimate it will rise to 24%, still the highest in a century.\nThe pause on some tariffs has made relatively little difference for two reasons.\nFirst, because the 10% universal rate on all US imports still applies.\nSecond, because of the president's simultaneous hike, alongside the pause, in the tariff rate imposed on all imports from China, from 104% to 125%.\nThe US imported $440bn (\u00a3340bn) of goods from China in 2024, according to official US data, external.\nThat still represented around 13% of all US goods imports.\nWhat does it mean for the global economy?\nMost economists think, even after the pause, this all represents a major shift in US trade policy, which will harm the global economy.\nAnd the intensification of the US trade war with China on top of this is expected to do further damage.\nChina and the US between them were projected to account for around 43% of the global economy by the International Monetary Fund in 2025, external.\nA slowdown in both economies as a result of the trade conflict will have a knock-on negative effect on most other countries.\nAnd economists caution that the impact of the additional uncertainty created by Trump's pause will in itself further undermine the world economy by holding back corporate investment.\nWhat about the UK?\nBefore the Trump pause, some hoped the UK could potentially benefit in some ways from the new round of Trump tariffs.\nThe UK's relatively lower tariff of 10% could have incentivised some multinational companies to produce more in Britain - rather than in the EU, which was facing a 20% tariff - for export to the US.\nWith the EU now facing the same US tariff as the UK that incentive has gone, although the UK government hopes to ultimately negotiate a free trade deal with the US to eliminate the 10% tariff.\nIt's also the case that the majority of the UK's exports to the US are services, external, rather than goods, and services are not affected by the US tariffs.\nNevertheless, the UK is now in the same position as almost every other country in the world with respect to US tariff barriers on goods.\nThe UK is still facing America's 25% tariff on aluminium and steel exports - and also on products derived from those metals.\nThe UK exported $720m (\u00a3558m) of raw steel and aluminium to America in 2024 according to United Nations data, external.\nAnd calculations by the Global Trade Alert research group, external suggest UK exports of metal products that are exposed to these new tariffs amounted to $2.9bn in 2024.\nThe UK is also subject to the new blanket US 25% import tariff on cars.\nData from the Office for National Statistics, external shows the UK exported $9bn of cars to the US in 2024, around a quarter of its total car exports.\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?\nRelated topics",

        "title": "Is the US making $2bn a day from tariffs? Trump claims fact-checked",
        "contents": "President Donald Trump has announced sweeping changes to his import tax regime to allow time for trade talks.\nA 90-day pause will be applied to countries that were facing tariffs over the 10% baseline. China, however, will see an even larger hike with tariffs on its imports rising to 125%.\nPresident Trump had been justifying his tariffs with a series of claims about how the US is the victim of \"unfair trade\".\nHowever, several of his claims about global trade were unsubstantiated or even false. BBC Verify has been taking a closer look.\nIs the US making $2bn a day from tariffs?\nBefore the 90-day pause, Trump claimed \"we're making a fortune with tariffs - $2bn a day\".\nHe made the claim on Tuesday, one day before the pause. Trump then repeated the figure in front of reporters following the latest changes, saying \"we're now making  $2bn a day\" - although he did not specifically link the number to tariffs.\nBut BBC Verify cannot find any published figures which show this.\nThe US Treasury Department publishes a daily statement, external on how much money from customs duties goes to the federal government.\nData from 8 April - which includes the impact of some of Trump's earlier tariffs - amounted to $192m (\u00a3149m).\nThat figure is well short of Trump's claim.\nIt is possible that he has based his claim on forecasts for the year ahead.\nThe US imported $9bn (\u00a37bn) worth of goods per day last year, external.\nSome analysts have calculated that the average rate of Trump's tariffs - after the initial announcement  - was 22%.\nApplying this to these import figures would get you to $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) a day.\nBut this calculation assumes that the volume of US imports would stay at this level.\nAnother way Trump could have reached his figure is by basing it on what his trade advisor said on 6 April - when the global tariffs were initially announced.\nPeter Navarro claimed the tariffs would raise $700bn (\u00a3546bn) a year, external and - from this - you can get to around $2bn a day.\nIt is not clear how Navarro came up with his figure and analysts have since argued that it could be much lower.\nBBC Verify has asked the White House for Trump's evidence.\nChina retaliates with 84% tariffs on US goods as Trump trade war escalates\nWhat are tariffs and why is Trump using them?\nHow were Donald Trump's tariffs calculated?\nIs the US running a $1 trillion deficit with China?\nA trade deficit happens when a country buys more from another country than it sells to it and Trump claims the US has a huge one with China.\n\"We have a trillion dollar trade deficit with China\", Trump told reporters on 7 April.\nThe US does have a large trade deficit in goods with China.\nOfficial figures show it was just over $295bn (\u00a3230bn) in 2024 , external- which is far less than the $1tn (\u00a3780bn) claimed by Trump.\nGlobally, in 2024, China exported nearly $1tn (\u00a3780bn) more goods than it imported, external.\nBut, contrary to what Trump said, that figure applies to all countries, not just the US.\nDoes Canada charge 270% on US dairy products?\nTrump has claimed that Canada charges US farmers a 270% tariff on their dairy products.\n\"Canada charges for our dairy products 270%. Nobody knows that. They charge you 2% for the first two cartons of milk and after that you go up to 270,\" Trump said.\nIt is correct that Canada does impose high tariffs on US dairy products - including 241% for milk, 270% for dairy powder and 298% for butter, external - but they only apply under specific conditions.\nUnder the Canadian system, US dairy goods can enter the country duty-free or with very low tariffs - until certain quotas are exceeded, external. Once this happens, higher tariffs are applied.\nA tariff war could create uncertainly for American dairy farmers\nAccording to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the US exported $1.14bn (\u00a3892m) worth of dairy products to Canada in 2024, external.\nDespite the volume of trade between the two countries, the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) - which represents America's dairy industry - said \"the US has never gotten close\" to exceeding the quotas, external.\nThe IDFA has, however, supported Trump challenging Canada's approach, saying that tariff quotas as well as Canada's milk pricing policy was distorting trade, external. But it also said a tariff war would \"create uncertainly and additional costs for American dairy farmers\".\nTrade expert David Henig, from the European Centre for International Political Economy, told BBC Verify that Canada is highly protective of its dairy market, but pointed out that \"President Trump actually negotiated the most recent trade deal between Canada and the US\".\nTrump also claimed Canada charges higher tariffs after the \"first two cartons of milk\". Al Mussell, from Agri-Food Economic Systems, told BBC Verify that tariff-quotas are typically measured in tonnes.\n\"I suppose the president was joking but in any event,  it's not a couple of cartons\", he said.\nDoes the EU import no US cars?\nTrump is exaggerating when he says that the EU takes \"no\" cars.\nAs well as China, Trump singled out the European Union (EU) which he said had been formed \"to screw the United States\".\n\"You know, we take their millions of cars. They take no cars. They don't take our farm products. They don't take anything\", he said.\nWhile the US imports more cars from the EU than it exports to it, Trump's claim that they take no cars is false.\nIn 2024, the EU imported 164,857 US-made cars valued at \u20ac7.7bn (\u00a36.6bn), according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), external.\nMany more did go the other way - 749,170 EU-made cars were exported to the US last year valued at \u20ac38.5bn (\u00a333.3bn).\nTrump's claim about farm products is also false.\nThe EU bought $12.8bn (\u00a310bn) of US agricultural exports in 2024, making the EU America's fourth largest export market - according to the USDA. , external\nBBC Verify will be looking at more trade claims.\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?\nRelated topics",

        "contents": "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy\nPresident Donald Trump has built another wall, and he thinks everyone else is going to pay for it. But his decision to impose sweeping tariffs of at least 10% on almost every product that enters the US is essentially a wall designed to keep work and jobs within it, rather than immigrants out.\nThe height of this wall needs to be put in historical context. It takes the US back a century in terms of protectionism. It catapults the US way above the G7 and G20 nations into levels of customs revenue, associated with Senegal, Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan.\nWhat occurred this week was not just the US starting a global trade war, or sparking a rout in stock markets. It was the world's hyper power firmly turning its back on the globalisation process it had championed, and from which it handsomely profited in recent decades.\nAnd in so doing, using the equation that underpinned his grand tariff reveal on the Rose Garden's lawns, the White House also turned its back on some fundamentals of both conventional economics and diplomacy.\nThe great free trade debate\nTrump talked a lot about 1913 in his announcement. This was a turning point when the US both created federal income tax and significantly lowered its tariffs.\nBefore this point, from its inception, the US government was funded mainly by tariffs, and was unapologetically protectionist, based on the strategy of its first Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton.\nThe basic lesson the White House has taken from this is that high tariffs made America, made it \"great\" the first time, and also meant that there was no need for a federal income tax.\nOn this side of the Atlantic, underpinning globalisation and free trade are the theories of 19th-Century British economist David Ricardo. In particular, the 1817 Theory of Comparative Advantage.\nThere are equations, but the basics are pretty easy to understand: Individual countries are good at making different things, based on their own natural resources and the ingenuity of their populations.\nBroadly speaking, the whole world, and the countries within it, are better off, if everyone specialises in what they are best at, and then trades freely.\nThe basic lesson the White House has taken from history is that high tariffs made America \"great\" the first time\nHere in Britain this remains a cornerstone of the junction between politics and economics. Most of the world still believes in comparative advantage. It is the intellectual core of globalisation.\nBut the US was never a full convert at the time. The underlying reluctance of the US never disappeared. And this week's manifestation of that was the imaginative equation created by the US Trade Representative to generate the numbers on Trump's big board.\nThe rationale behind 'reciprocal' tariffs\nIt is worth unpacking the rationale for these so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs. The numbers bear little resemblance to the published tariff rates in those countries.\nThe White House said adjustments had been made to account for red tape and currency manipulation. A closer look at the, at-first, complicated looking equation revealed it was simply a measure of the size of that country's goods trade surplus with the US. They took the size of the trade deficit and divided it by the imports.\nIn the hour before the press conference a senior White House official explained it quite openly. \"These tariffs are customised to each country, calculated by the Council of Economic Advisers\u2026 The model they use is based on the concept the trade deficit that we have is the sum of all the unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating.\"\nThis is really important. According to the White House, the act of selling more goods to the US than the US sells to you, is by definition \"cheating\" and is deserving of a tariff that is calculated to correct that imbalance.\nThe long-term aim is to get the US $1.2 trillion trade deficit down to zero\nThis is why the surreal stories about the US tariffing rarely visited islands only inhabited by penguins matter. It reveals the actual method.\nThe long-term aim, and the target of the policy, is to get the US $1.2 trillion trade deficit and the largest country deficits within that down to zero. The equation was simplistically designed to target those countries with surpluses, not those with recognisable quantifiable trade barriers. It targeted poor countries, emerging economies and tiny irrelevant islets based on that data.\nWhile these two different factors overlap, they are not the same thing.\nThere are many reasons why some countries have surpluses, and some have deficits. There is no inherent reason why these numbers should be zero. Different countries are better at making different products, and have different natural and human resources. This is the very basis of trade.\nThe US appears no longer to believe in this. Indeed if the same argument was applied solely to trade in services, the US has a $280bn (\u00a3216bn) surplus in areas such as financial services and social media tech.\nYet services trade was excluded from all the White House calculations.\n'China shock' and the ripple effect\nThere is something bigger here. As the US Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that \"rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things\".\nThat has not panned out, especially in the case of China, so the US is moving decisively away from this world.\nFor the US, it is not David Ricardo who matters, it is David Autor, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist and the coiner of the term \"China shock\".\nIn 2001, as the world was distracted by the aftermath of 9/11, China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), having relatively free access to US markets, and so transforming the global economy.\nLiving standards, growth, profits and stock markets boomed in the US as China's workforce migrated from the rural fields to the coastal factories to produce exports more cheaply for US consumers. It was a classic example of the functioning of \"comparative advantage\". China generated trillions of dollars, much of which was reinvested in the US, in the form of its government bonds, helping keep interest rates down.\nPresident Trump's characterisation of the past half century of freer trade as having \"raped and pillaged\" the US doesn't reflect the overall picture, says Faisal Islam\nEveryone was a winner. Well, not quite. Essentially US consumers en masse got richer with cheaper goods, but the quid pro quo was a profound loss of manufacturing to East Asia.\nAutor's calculation was that by 2011, this \"China shock\" saw the loss of one million US manufacturing jobs, and 2.4 million jobs overall. These hits were geographically concentrated in the Rust Belt and the south.\nThe trade shock impact on lost jobs and wages was remarkably persistent.\nAutor further updated his analysis last year and found that while the Trump administration's first term dabble with tariff protection had little net economic impact, it did loosen Democrat support in affected areas, and boosted support for Trump in the 2020 presidential election.\nMore from InDepth\nMarine Le Pen's ban outraged France's far right - and they may well take revenge\nThe influencers who want the world to have more babies - and say the White House is on their side\nTrump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling\nFast forward to this week, and the array of union car workers and oil and gas workers celebrating the tariffs in the White House.\nSo the promise is that these jobs will return, not just to the Rust Belt, but across the US. This is indeed likely to some degree. The president's clear message to foreign companies is to avoid the tariffs by moving your factories. The carrots offered by Biden followed by the stick from Trump could well lead to material progress on this.\nBut the president's characterisation of the past half century of freer trade as having \"raped and pillaged\" the US obviously doesn't reflect the overall picture, even if it has not worked for specific regions, sectors or demographics.\nThe US service sector thrived, dominating the world from Wall Street and Silicon Valley. US consumer brands used hyper-efficient supply chains stretching into China and East Asia to make incredible profits selling their aspirational American products everywhere.\nThe US economy did very well indeed. The problem, simply, was that it was not evenly distributed among sectors. And what the US lacked was levels of redistribution and adaptation to spread that wealth across the country. This reflects America's political choices.\nThe first social media trade war\nNow, as the US chooses to reshore its manufacturing with a sudden jolt of protectionism, other countries also have choices as to whether to support the flows of capital and trade that have made the US rich.\nThe world's consumers have choices.\nIt is little wonder major blue chip American companies, which have built cash machines on hyper-efficient East Asian supply chains producing cheaply and then selling to the whole world based on their attractive aspirational brands, have a big problem.\nTheir share prices are particularly badly affected because the president has both decimated their supply chain strategies, and also risks greatly impairing their brand image amongst global consumers.\nGlobalisation has failed, according to the current Trump administration\nUltimately, this is the first social media trade war. The experience of Tesla's sale slump and Canada's backlash against US goods may prove contagious. That would be as powerful as any counter-tariff.\nThese countries that bet on being the workshops for US consumers have choices over trade too. New alliances will form and intensify that seek to cut out an erratic US.\nThe president's sensitivity to this was apparent when he threatened to increase tariffs if the EU and Canada joined forces over retaliation. This would be the nightmare scenario.\nIn the game theory of trade wars, credibility does matter. The US has unrivalled military and technological might, which helps. But to transform the global trading system using an arbitrary formula, that throws up transparent absurdities, even without the penguins, is likely to encourage the other side to resist.\nThis is especially the case when the rest of the world thinks that the loaded gun that the president is holding is being aimed at his own foot. The stock market fell most in the US. Inflation will go up most in the US. It is Wall Street now calculating a more-than-evens chance of a recession in the US.\nPerhaps there is some substance to the theory that the real objective here is to weaken the dollar and lower US borrowing costs.\nFor now, the US is checking out of the global trade system it created. It can continue without it. But the transition is going to be very messy indeed.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "title": "War has changed Zelensky - but now is the time for him to transform again",
        "contents": "War has changed Zelensky - but now is the time for him to transform again\nListen to James read this article\n\"The best salesman in history.\" This was what Donald Trump once called Volodymyr Zelensky because of the amount of aid the US has given Ukraine.\nWhether or not a fair comparison, Zelensky's role in keeping his country in the spotlight and convincing allies to invest has certainly been crucial for Ukraine's fight.\nHis transformation from prime-time comedian to wartime president has long been cast - it dates back to 2022 when he decided to remain in Kyiv as Russian troops closed in. That decision meant Ukraine would go on to defend itself to this day.\nIn the years since, I've stood across from him in person dozens of times, and Zelensky now casts a more authoritative, perhaps battle-hardened figure, moulded partly by his increased isolation on the international stage.\nBut with the unpredictability of Trump's second term - not least following the pair's Oval Office bust-up in February - Zelensky may now have to transform again.\nTrump has represented a growing Republican fatigue with Russia's war in Ukraine\nPolitically it is no longer a story of oppressor versus oppressed. Rather, it is muddied by the dual challenge of voicing an appetite for peace whilst protecting his country's interests.\nBut is a man used to having so much authority at home and being so influential abroad really going to stage a second big transformation, shifting his focus to Trump-era diplomacy? Or will he decide the best way of standing up for Ukraine is to yield little?\n'Very clever and calculated'\nLater today the \"coalition of the willing\", a group of nations who have pledged to stand with Ukraine, will meet at Nato headquarters - notably without America.\nBefore Trump's chapter two began, Ukraine's leader had effectively lobbied for western support. He appealed for air defences, tanks, rockets and fighter jets, with nations such as Germany hesitating over fears of the war escalating, before yielding to his requests.\nHis message was rigid and he was successful in procuring support.\n\"Zelensky was very clever and calculated in the early days of the war,\" says Ed Arnold from defence and security think tank, Royal United Services Institute (Rusi).\nHis decision go to the Munich security conference two weeks before the invasion, despite being advised that this would be a security risk, was pivotal, argues Mr Arnold.\n\"It personalised support to Ukraine within the minds of people who personally attended.\"\nZelensky was a comedian when he announced that he would be running in Ukraine's 2019 presidential election\nSerhiy Leshchenko, an advisor to Zelensky's office, explains: \"We have to be visible to the world. If public opinion is on Ukraine's side, there is a better chance to get help from the international community.\"\nLeshchenko points to Zelensky's daily video addresses, which he has created since start of the invasion. \"It's unusual to be so open.\"\nUkraine's victory in the battle of Kyiv cemented Zelensky as a symbol of the country's survival, and boosted his case for continued military aid from western allies.\nLater in 2022, Zelensky was able to demonstrate the difference their supplies were making when swathes of Ukrainian territory, including the city of Kherson, were liberated. He had initial success with European allies.\n\"They are invested in Zelensky personally and Ukraine,\" says Mr Arnold. \"He's gone through four UK prime ministers since the start of the war \u2026 and they've all signed new declarations with Ukraine, again through Zelensky.\n\"He's been able to weather the changes in national politics within Europe throughout his tenure.\"\nBut when further successes failed to materialise, Zelensky's message did not change - and as time went on, this would be to his detriment.\n\"Zelensky's diplomacy really didn't adjust quickly enough,\" argues one expert\nAfter Ukraine's failed counter-offensive in the summer of 2023, for example, the merits of supporting Kyiv were increasingly questioned by an influential minority of US Republicans and pleas were starting to be passed over in some quarters.\nMaria Zolkina, head of regional security and conflict studies at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, a Kyiv-based think tank, believes Zelensky is partly responsible.\n\"He and his close circle relied on the logic that they must always be demanding when speaking with their partners - pushing the argument that Ukraine simply needs something. That worked really well during 2022, but with the US and others this kind of messaging stopped working in 2023,\" she argues.\n\"But his diplomacy really didn't adjust quickly enough.\"\n'Zelensky has never been a diplomat'\nOn 27 September 2024, in a lobby in New York, things truly changed for Ukraine. Only the driving force was not approaching Russian armour but the political reincarnation of Ukraine's biggest ally: the US.\nOn that day, just over a month before the US Presidential election, Zelensky had a last minute meeting with Trump in Trump Tower.\nTensions between the pair had heightened before this meeting: Zelensky had claimed a few days earlier that Trump didn't \"really know how to end the war\", after he asserted he could do it in \"one day\".\nAfter the Trump Tower meeting, the two men emerged looking awkward.\nDespite announcing a \"common view\" of wanting to end the war, their body language suggested a lack of chemistry.\nThe pair would not meet again until five months later in the Oval Office, where their now famous encounter would be a diplomatic disaster for Kyiv.\n\"Trump should have liked him,\" says Vadym Prystaiko, who was present when the pair first met after Zelensky's election win in 2019. \"Zelensky saw Trump as more or less as himself, as a media guy who moved into politics, who was anti-establishment,\" he says.\nMr Prystaiko was Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, before he was sacked in 2023. Kyiv gave no official reason for the dismissal, but it came after Mr Prystaiko criticised Zelensky's response to a row over gratitude for British military aid. He said there had been a \"little bit of sarcasm\" in his president's response, which he believed was \"unhealthy\".\n\"Zelensky has never been a diplomat,\" Mr Prystaiko adds. \"He has never been a usual political leader who kisses babies and shakes hands.\"\nA 'rollercoaster' relationship\n\"The relationship with Trump is like a rollercoaster,\" says Volodymyr Fesenko, director at the Penta Center for Political Studies. \"Sometimes there is constructive cooperation, and then, all of a sudden, some kind of crisis appears.\"\nThen there is their war of words. Trump has blamed Zelensky for starting the war, calling him a \"dictator\", while Ukraine's leader accused his US counterpart  of \"living in a Russian disinformation space\".\nWhile Mr Fesenko believes Zelensky is continually changing tactics to find a working relationship with Washington, Ms Zolkina believes the issues go deeper.\n\"There is a triangle between the US administration, the Kremlin and Kyiv,\" she claims. \"Ukraine is considered to be a weaker part of this triangle. For Trump, Zelensky is not in the same league, and that's the problem.\"\nTrump has blamed Zelensky for starting the war and called him a dictator\nWhen it came to the now infamous Oval Office meeting with Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, this was the first time I'd seen Zelensky seemingly run out of political rope as he was accused of \"not showing enough gratitude\" and \"playing with World War Three\".\nHis defensive body language, the folding of his arms for example, also seemed new.\nZelensky has always appeared comfortable hosting or visiting other leaders. He is at ease on a stage and often injects timely humour \u2014 but this was different.\nA mineral agreement, in which Zelensky had originally suggested trading a portion of Ukraine's mineral resource wealth for continued military aid, was never signed, and has since evolved into a less favourable proposal for Kyiv.\nThe US would also briefly pause its military aid and intelligence sharing to ensure Ukraine danced to its tune.\nZelensky was able to demonstrate the difference supplies were making when swathes of Ukrainian territory, including the city of Kherson, were liberated\nBut the official view from some is that the Oval Office meeting was not a calamity.\n\"Nobody took it as the end of something,\" claims Ihor Brusylo, the deputy head of the Presidential Office, who travelled to the White House with Zelensky. \"We discussed how to move forward. It was not a disaster.\"\nWhen the US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told them the meeting was over, \"we just shrugged our shoulders and decided to go back to the hotel,\" he recalls.\n\"My presumption is that on a personal level, they [Trump and Zelensky] get on well,\" he adds. \"They understand each other better, and are frank and honest.\"\nWhatever the truth about their relationship behind closed doors, there have been signs of a willingness to bend from Zelensky since that meeting - European allies are said to have convinced him to subsequently take a more compliant tone, because of the inescapable truth that they, and Ukraine, still need the US to combat an aggressive Russia.\nYet others argue more bend still is needed.\n'It is very difficult to bend Zelensky'\n\"The war changes everyone, it has changed us all in some sense. But I don't think fundamentally Zelensky has changed - for good or bad in some instances,\" says Olga Onuch, professor of Comparative and Ukrainian Politics at the University of Manchester.\n\"It is very clear that certain actors have decided it's difficult to negotiate with Zelensky. Why? Because he has red lines that he is sticking to.\"\nMore from InDepth\nTrump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy\nTrump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling\nRussia's next move? The countries trying to Putin-proof themselves\nMr Brusylo agrees. \"It is very difficult to bend Zelensky,\" he says. \"It's like watching a spring, the more you press, the bigger the pushback.\"\nAnd yet whenever Ukraine is attacked, politically or diplomatically, increased political unity follows. The Oval Office clash was no exception, as Zelensky's popularity rating soared to around 70%.\n\"Zelensky is very powerful, and his authority is made up of himself and a certain circle of people,\" argues Ms Zolkina.\nOrysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House says it's interesting how Ukrainians rallied around Zelensky after the Oval Office, almost like they took it as a personal insult of Ukrainian statehood.\n\"People rally around him, what he represents and how he behaves\".\nMr Prystaiko argues if the Americans wanted him to be replaced \"they've shot themselves in the foot as he might easily be re-elected\".\nSome political experts, like Ms Zolkina, do not think this is a certainty. \"I don't think he understands that this boost is a direct reaction to what Trump is doing, not his personal position,\" she says.\n\"He has pretty strong political ambitions for a second term, and is pretty politically egocentric, as all leaders are at his level.\"\nZelensky's daily video addresses haven't stopped since the start of the invasion\nProf Onuch does not think that pursuit of political power alone motivates Zelensky. \"[He is] much more of a careful and considered and tactical political operator than people give him credit for\".\nStill, imagining a Zelensky second term can be difficult, simply because of the sheer demands of the job. Even post-war challenges would be considerable.\nFor now, Mr Arnold suspects that an exhausted Zelensky would not want to stand again and suggests that he may want a way out from at least the frontline politics.\nAs for the near-term, Zelensky cannot afford another Oval Office. So, given that Trump is a keen player, will Ukraine's leader ever join him for a round of golf?\n\"He is a quick learner,\" says his Mr Brusylo. \"When there is a need to play golf, I'm sure he will tackle this task.\"\n\nTop picture credit: Getty Images\nAdditional reporting by Hanna Chornous and Vicky Riddell\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

        "title": "David Dimbleby: I thought the free market was with us forever - then Trump came along",
        "contents": "David Dimbleby: I thought the free market was with us forever - then Trump came along\nI remember 1974 well. With inflation on the rise, the government had been locked in battle with trade unions over worker pay. The government appeared paralysed: stand up to the miners and strikes could shut down the power system, but give in and pay them more money and inflation would rocket.\nAnd then the global oil crisis came out of nowhere. It threw economies, including Britain's, into chaos. The government introduced a three-day week. Power cuts were common - we would be plunged into darkness without warning. And seemingly, the government just expected us to deal with it.\nThis was also the year I began presenting the BBC's current affairs programme Panorama. We spent a lot of time debating these issues. People came on with all kinds of different ideas of what to do.\nThere were even suggestions that what the country really needed to take back control from the unions was a military takeover - a coup.\nConservative prime minister Harold Macmillan spoke proudly of Britain's welfare state, saying it had built strong defences against poverty and illness\nThere was another idea out there too. It was proposed by the Conservative politician Keith Joseph and was entirely radical - so removed from the mainstream, in fact, that during filming of Panorama, Joseph turned to the production team and asked exasperatedly if they understood what he meant.\nThat idea was the free market.\nThis meant Britain departing from the post World War Two consensus that government should control the economy and that instead if you left the markets alone, they would deliver the country greater prosperity and security.\nIf, in 2025, the idea sounds anything but radical, that's exactly the point.\nWhat we saw in the UK in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government was just how quickly the free market transitioned from a radical idea into the new reality. Then before long it became what many assumed was the system that would last forever.\nUS President Donald Trump is a billionaire businessman who has clearly done well financially out of capitalism. But suddenly, thanks in part to him, the free market system finds itself under assault like never before.\nIt might yet weather the storm. However others are asking, is the free market system fatally flawed and doomed to failure?\nThe fantasy world of Thatcher's Britain\nSo much of what Thatcher did in the wake of her 1983 general election victory seems so obvious now. We take it for granted that private companies play a pivotal role in providing our water, electricity, gas, railways, ports and freight.\nBut at the time few believed it possible to do what she had done - it seemed like a fantasy world, completely detached from how things had been done post war.\nDavid Dimbleby took over as presenter of Panorama in 1974, following in the footsteps of his father Richard Dimbleby\nI was six when the war ended. There was rationing \u2013 coupons that allowed you to buy meat or clothes, or of course, sweets. But out of these hard times and on the heels of victory, a new vision of society was emerging in Britain.\nWith Clement Attlee's landslide election victory in July 1945, for the first time in Britain's political history a majority cast their votes for a party ostensibly dedicated to socialism.\nBut more than that, a new consensus on how the country should run emerged, with those leading the Labour and Conservative parties singing from a broadly similar sheet.\n\"We have built our defences against want and sickness, and we're proud of it,\" was uttered not by a Labour prime minister but by Harold Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. This had been how things were done.\nHowever not everyone bought into the consensus. Antony Fisher, who was a chicken farmer, was exasperated by what he saw as the meddling of the Egg Marketing Board. He set up the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, inspired Keith Joseph and he in turn got Thatcher's ear.\nTrump's admiration of Thatcher\nThat the current assault on the free market is coming, in part, from a Republican US president seems all the more ironic given how popular Thatcher's reforms were with the American right.\nThatcher and President Ronald Reagan shared a similar world view, and Trump has spoken of his admiration for the two, albeit with the caveat that he didn't agree with some of Reagan's trade policies.\nThatcher was convinced that the country would be much better off if gas and water and electricity were taken out of the hands of the state. And sold on the open market. The free market. Just like buying a loaf of bread.\nA key policy of the Thatcher government was to sell shares in state-owned utilities not just to big businesses, but directly to the British public\nThe Thatcher government's big idea was that they weren't just going to sell the shares in state-owned utilities to big businesses or investors. They were going to offer them to the British people.\nIn December 1984 shares in British Telecom (BT) went on sale. The next morning, the numbers were staggering: more than two million Britons were now BT shareholders.\nAnd Thatcher began to realise that selling off these companies wasn't just about breaking the shackles of government control. It could be something bigger - turning every person in Britain into a capitalist and in doing so making capitalism popular.\nIn Britain, by the end of the 1980s, the scale of transformation was staggering. The sum of \u00a360bn was raised by selling off state run companies. Up to 15 million Britons were now shareholders.\nBritain was embracing the free market. This wasn't just an economic shift. It was a cultural revolution. A redefinition of Britain's relationship with money, with government, and with itself.\nInvisible Hands\nDavid Dimbleby traces the history of a hidden force that changed Britain - the free market revolution - and the invisible hands that shaped it. Episodes available weekly.\nAnd if Thatcher's privatisation had given ordinary people the chance to buy shares, her reforms to Britain's financial services sector in 1986, known as the Big Bang, gave ordinary people the chance to sell them too, to get a job in the previously closed world of the City.\nThere were many on the left for whom the principle alone of these reforms was something to object to. The assault on the free market from some on the right is not about the principles of the reforms, but the consequences.\nOffshore business and collapsing communities\nAt the core of Thatcher's thinking was a belief that free market capitalism could work only if many people had a direct stake in it. And with share ownership of previously state run utilities, many people did. But before long, alarm bells were starting to be rung. And their chime has only gotten louder.\nJames Goldsmith was a businessman who had made a fortune by buying struggling companies cheaply, reshaping them to maximise efficiency and then selling them at a profit. The 1980s reforms were like manna from heaven for him.\nBut then he seemed to change his mind about things. In 1994 he told a committee of US senators that its premise contained a fatal flaw - that the system demanded maximum profit but to achieve maximum profit that meant severing the umbilical link with many of your own electorate.\nJames Goldsmith warned that businesses would always move their operations wherever they could make the most profit\n\"You get to a system whereby, to get the best corporate profits, you have to leave your own country. You have to say to your own sales force 'Goodbye, we can't use you anymore - you're too expensive'.\n\"You've got unions. You want holidays. You want protection. So we're going offshore.\"\nGoldsmith was predicting that companies would take their business wherever they would make the most money. If you are a CEO answerable to shareholders that's literally your job description. And the result, he said, would be job losses in the West, with communities collapsing.\nAnd to make things worse, he argued that Britain had ceded sovereignty to the likes of the European Union and the World Trade Organization, with Britain binding itself to an economic system run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, only adding to the sense of alienation felt in collapsing communities. And with global markets dictating policy. If an industry wasn't profitable, it was left to die.\nToday, the UK may be a global leader in science and financial services but is that of much consolation to communities where we once made things that are now made offshore?\nBased on what I often heard in my many years touring the country presenting Question Time, I'm not sure it is.\nWhen Britain voted to leave the EU in 2016, strong support for Leave came from communities that felt left behind\nGoldsmith would end up trying to go into politics. His Referendum Party was trounced in the 1997 general election but he had planted a seed. He had argued that the global free market path that Britain and the rest of the world was going down was dangerous. That it would spread division around the world.\nFast-forward nearly 20 years to 2016 and his warning came to pass. Britain voted to leave the European Union and the verdict could not be clearer: the Leave vote was highest in those left-behind communities, seemingly fuelled by those who felt globalisation was not working for them.\nThe dream of a nation of shareholders has soured too.\nIn 1989 Thames Water was privatised. We were promised lower bills, better infrastructure, less red tape and investment in a system fraying at the edges. It was investment that the global capitalist system was supposedly best placed to provide.\nWhat followed was something else entirely. Debt ballooned and dividends flowed to shareholders. The company extracted profit while pipes leaked and sewage poured into rivers. And our bills now pay for interest on that debt - it feels like we've come a long way from Thatcher's nation of shareholders.\nTrump's tariffs 'defy easy explanation'\nBack in 1994, James Goldsmith had posited that the problem with the free market dream was that it didn't protect the home base.\nNow, there is someone else much more powerful who takes that view.\nPresident Trump's methods are so erratic that with him it's hard to tell what is going on. His readiness to slap hugely consequential tariffs on countries that are both traditional foes and supposed friends at times defies easy explanation.\nBut what we can say is that he is trying to return to ideas that preceded the free market. He is trying to make America strong through protectionism, making it harder for anyone to simply sell anywhere.\nDonald Trump's policies are an attempt to return the US to an earlier economic model\nThere is an argument that if you take the long view then perhaps the free market period is the outlier. Britain itself had a long, long period of protectionism before it embraced free trade.\nTariffs are nothing new in world economic history and in a sense Trump is just trying to return the US to how things were, albeit in quite a chaotic way.\nThe reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge. But that challenge is coming not from supporters of socialism who ideologically back a big role for the state. Instead, the challenge is coming from Trump, a man who is broadly speaking of the right and has no qualms with capitalism allowing people to become very rich.\nThat the challenge is coming from within is what makes it so potent.\n\nTop image credit: Getty Images\nMore from InDepth\nTrump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling\nRussia's next move?

Our correspondents answer your questions.\nFrom Saturday, most goods imported to the US from anywhere in the world will face a 10% \"baseline\" tariff.\nDonald Trump announced higher rates for some countries he singled out as the \"worst offenders\" for trade.\nOur correspondents have been answering your questions about what this means and the impact it could have.\nWill the tariffs lead to a stagnant global economy?\nDavid Rash, in Yeovil, asks Deputy Economics editor, Dharshini David, if the tariffs will lead to a stagnant world economy following a reduced supply of foreign goods into the US and a reduction of US exports?\nThis is a very real risk.\nThe tariffs introduced by President Trump amount to the largest such levy to face American consumers in almost a century.\nIf they do get put in place \u2013 and remain \u2013 there is likely to be a serious dent to the amount bought by Americans, still the world's biggest shoppers, from the rest of the world.\nAnd those who are prepared to fork out for higher prices due to tariffs will have less to spend on other things.\nIn the event of the retaliation threatened by other countries, American exporters will suffer \u2013 hence the concern that not just the US but the whole global economy, so reliant on trade flows, could slow.\nBut as you say, the natural inclination is for countries hardest hit \u2013 toymakers from China to apparel manufacturers in Vietnam - to boost sale in other markets.\nThat might appeal to consumers \u2013 but obviously, could disadvantage businesses in those target markets.\nWhat happens to US products that are made in China?\nMike Heafield, 60, in Preston, asks Senior Technology reporter, Graham Fraser, What happens to products - like the iPhone - that are made in China by US companies?\nOne eye-catching consequence of the tariffs announcement has been the impact on Apple, with its share price falling 7%.\nThe US tech giant has large manufacturing bases in some of the countries hit hardest by President Trump's policy - notably China, which faces tariffs of 54%, and Vietnam (46%).\nIn 2019, when Trump was first in the White House, Apple was given Chinese tariff exemptions. Apple bosses will be hoping to work out a similar deal this time.\nThe global investment bank Citi said: \"If Apple cannot get exempted this time and assuming Apple gets hit by the accumulative 54% China tariffs and does not pass it through, we estimate about 9% negative impact to the company's total gross margin.\"\nIn February, Apple committed to invest more than $500bn (\u00a3396bn) in the US over the next four years. At the time, Trump claimed Apple's support for US manufacturing was partially a response to his trade policies, including tariffs.\nHow will the tariffs impact US consumers?\nPaul Miller, in Devon, asks Dharshini David, Deputy Economics editor, about the impact of tariffs on US consumers, and whether the UK could gain from them.\nUS shoppers could very much be the frontline casualties in this trade war, blighted by higher prices and less choice, regardless of the president's rhetoric.\nAnd that does mean that producers will seek out and take advantage of new markets.\nWe saw that in the president's first term, when the likes of Vietnam and Malaysia took advantage of the tariffs he imposed on China to increase the amount they sold to America.\nIronically, they consequently are in the firing line now - and so will likely be vying to sell more to the UK \u2013 good for consumers, less so for competing businesses\nAlready, many producers are turning their sights beyond established customers \u2013 think whisky makers looking towards Asia. That is likely to intensify.\nTrump's announcement may mean a redraft of the global trade map \u2013 and our own shopping lists.\nLive updates: Reaction to Trump's tariffs announcement\nAt a glance: What president's new taxes mean for EU, China and others\nWill this have an effect on the UK's cost of living?\nJock Scott, from Nuneaton, asks Business reporter Nick Edser if the US tariffs have an effect on the UK's cost of living.\nAs ever when looking at the implications of the tariffs, there's a lot of uncertainty over this. In some circumstances UK prices could go up, in others they could fall.\nThe tariffs announced by Trump on Wednesday will be paid for by the businesses which import goods into the US. This means the initial impact of price rises is likely to be on US consumers, if American firms pass on the extra costs.\nHowever, some economists think the tariffs could strengthen the value of the dollar against other currencies. If the pound weakens against the dollar, then UK firms importing goods from the US will face higher costs. This could then lead to higher prices of these goods in UK shops if companies cannot absorb the increased costs themselves.\nAlso, if the UK government decides to retaliate with tariffs of its own on US goods entering the UK, there is a risk UK prices could rise if British businesses pass on the extra costs to customers.\nHowever, some economists have suggested prices could also fall as a result of the tariffs.\nSwati Dhingra, an economist and member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, has suggested that firms which normally send their goods to the US may instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK, potentially leading to a flood of cheaper goods.\nWhat does this mean for my pension?\nRobert Jones, from Cardiff, asks Kevin Peachey, Cost of living correspondent, about the impact of tariffs on our pension investments.\nThere is little doubt Trump's announcement on tariffs has led to immediate moves in share prices and are also likely to have a longer-term economic impact.\nRobert and Stephen have mentioned the drop in the value of their pension investments, and the situation will be unsettling for millions of people with any kind of investments.\nExperts say that investors have always had to ride economic shocks. Investments, by definition, require a long-term outlook and strategy. So, they are urging people not to panic or make knee-jerk decisions.\nThat said, for those about to draw on investments, it may be more worrying, albeit that most pension savings are moved into safer holdings like cash or bonds as people approach retirement age. The state pension is unaffected.\nDoes the UK have a 'Brexit benefit' over the EU?\nPaul Naldrett from Windsor asks Business correspondent Marc Ashdown if the UK's position outside of the European Union is actually an opportunity as the EU is given 20% tariffs.\nSome are referring to a \"Brexit benefit\" because the UK is only subject to 10% tariffs rather than the 20% being slapped on the EU.\nNot only will that limit the pain felt by British businesses compared to their European neighbours, but it could present trading opportunities.\nUK exporters to America could have a competitive edge, with US importers only facing half the tax by dealing with UK businesses instead of EU businesses.\nBritish firms - and consumers - could also benefit from cheaper goods finding their way here instead of America if the extra costs prove insurmountable.\nBut, there are concerns about the impact that could have on homegrown industries if cheap products, possibly with lower standards, flood the UK market.\nRelated topics",

        "contents": "Apple plans to invest more than $500bn (\u00a3396bn) in the US over the next four years, starting with a new advanced manufacturing factory in Texas.\nThe tech giant said it expected to create 20,000 new jobs over that time, with the \"vast majority\" of roles in research and development, software and artificial intelligence (AI).\nIt is not clear to what extent the spending is an acceleration of the company's current activities. Apple said the sum included everything from spending on suppliers to Apple TV+ productions.\nThe announcement comes days after Apple boss Tim Cook met with President Donald Trump, who has made increased corporate investment in the US a priority.\nIn its announcement, external, Apple said its investment was its \"largest-ever spend commitment\" and would expand its support for American manufacturing.\n\"We are bullish on the future of American innovation,\" Cook said.\nThe new 250,000 sq ft factory in Houston, Texas, is set to produce servers that were \"previously manufactured outside the US\" to support Apple Intelligence, the company's AI system, the company said.\nThe iPhone maker added it would open in 2026 and create thousands of jobs.\nApple is also expanding its data centre capacity in North Carolina, Iowa, Oregon, Arizona and Nevada, and doubling its support for a fund dedicated to US manufacturing, which it created in Trump's first term, from $5bn to $10bn.\nTrump previewed the announcement last week, claiming it was partially a response to his trade policies, including tariffs.\nOn Monday, the president took credit for the news on social media, saying the reason for the investment was \"faith in what we are doing, without which, they wouldn't be investing ten cents\".\nWhat are tariffs and why is Trump using them?\nTrump launches plan to target countries with new tariffs\nTrump tariff VAT threat raises fears of hit to UK\nTrump has said he wants to see more companies making their products in the US, threatening to raise tariffs drastically in a bid to make domestic manufacturing more attractive.\nLast month, he imposed a new 10% border tax on all imports from China, where Apple has a significant manufacturing presence.\nHe has also proposed tariffs on products made in many other countries, including neighbouring nations Mexico and Canada.\nEileen Burbidge, a venture capital investor in tech businesses and a founding partner of Passion Capital, said Apple had made similar announcements before.\nIn 2018 the company announced a $350bn investment in the US, and in 2021 it said it was committing $430bn to its home market, both times saying the investments would add 20,000 jobs over five years.\n\"It's starting to become a bit business as usual,\" she told the BBC. \"But obviously it's music to Donald Trump's ears.\"\nInvesting in its own research and development (R&D) was in the company's best interests, she said, although the US investment was \"relatively small\" compared to what it spends on R&D globally.\n\"[But] bringing some of that back to the US - again that's a really smart political move to make these large announcements in order to demonstrate commitment to US industry.\"\nRelated topics",
